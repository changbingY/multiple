Sentence (with missing item): taním ___ na laád-u
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL.ERG ___ NEG find.PFV"=MSG
The English translation of this sentence is:`They didn't find anything.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The pronoun the morpheme ___ belongs to a~set of indefinite"=interrogative pronouns and is in itself neutral (rather than negative). It could, however, be argued that the combination the morpheme ___ na phonologically is one word, as occurring in (\ref{ex:14-67}) and (\ref{ex:14-68}), and as such constitutes a~negative pronoun. In any case we have only one morpheme with a~clearly negative semantics in sentences like these.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The possible emergence of a~set of negative pronouns is even more obvious with combinations indefinite"=interrogative pronoun + bi `also' + na, as in examples (\ref{ex:14-70})--(\ref{ex:14-72}). Neither do these ``negative compounds'' occur with an~additionally negated verb; instead the entire predication lies in the scope of this negative pronoun, itself in preverbal position in the clause. Probably the morpheme bi contributes an~added emphasis to the negation, approximately corresponding to `at all, else'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`There is no news at all.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A marginal case where double negation may be argued to occur is when a~particle hiǰ `at all' (derived from Persian or Pashto where it has a~clearly negative value) is added to the indefinite"=interrogative ɡa in a~negated clause, such as in (\ref{ex:14-73}) and (\ref{ex:14-74}). We may on the other hand say that it is used in a~way very similar to bi, thus primarily adding emphasis to the already negative expression.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He went there, during the night, not during the day.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \spitzmarke{Negation of subunits.} In the examples, so far, the entire predicate lies in the scope of the negation. But it is also possible to negate only a~phrase or a~subunit of a~clause, as in (\ref{ex:14-75})--(\ref{ex:14-77}).
