You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): \ꞌI tū hora era o ___ \obe rere mai era\,\cb...
Gloss (with missing item): at DEM time DIST of ___ {\db}IPFV jump hither DIST
The English translation of this sentence is:‘At the moment when Kekoa jumped...’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Possessive-relative constructions occur in other Polynesian languages as well. There has been some discussion on the question whether the possessor\is{Possession} is raised from the subject\is{Subject!raising} position of the relative clause\is{Clause!relative} (e.g. \citealt[367]{Harlow2000}; \citealt[185]{Harlow2007Maori}), or whether it is a genuine noun phrase possessor\is{Possession} which happens to be coreferential to the relative clause subject \citep[116]{Clark1976}. In Rapa Nui the second option is more plausible. First, the possessor\is{Possession} can be in the same positions as in any other noun phrase, which suggests that it is no different from other possessors in the noun phrase. Second, as the examples above show, the form of the possessive construction varies between \is{Possession!o/a distinction}a- and o-possession: a{}-possession in \REF{ex:11.123}, \REF{ex:11.125} and \REF{ex:11.127}, o{}-possession in \REF{ex:11.124} and \REF{ex:11.126}. As a- and o-possession express different semantic relationships between possessor\is{Possession} and possessee (\sectref{sec:6.3.2}), this suggests that there is a direct relation between the possessor\is{Possession} and the head noun, even though the primary function of the possessor\is{Possession} seems to be the expression of the relative clause\is{Clause!relative} subject.\footnote{\label{fn:517}\citet{HerdMacdonald2011} make a similar observation for other Polynesian languages. They propose a structure where there is a relation between the possessor\is{Possession} and the relative construction as a whole. This involves a control relation (not raising) between possessor\is{Possession} and relative clause\is{Clause!relative} subject.} And indeed, in most of these cases the choice between \textit{{\ꞌ}a} and o is governed by the same principles guiding this choice in possessive constructions in general. In \REF{ex:11.127}, where the relation between possessor\is{Possession} and head noun is one between husband and wife, \textit{{\ꞌ}a} is used (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.1.1}). In \REF{ex:11.125}, the use of \textit{{\ꞌ}a} is possibly motivated by the active relationship of the possessee to the head noun ‘work’ (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.2} item 2). In \REF{ex:11.126}, o is used with a temporal noun, again conforming to a general pattern (\sectref{sec:6.3.3.3} item 11). In fact, given the wide range of relationships expressed by possessive constructions in Rapa Nui, all possessive-relatives seem to exhibit some kind of possessive relationship also attested in simple possessive constructions.

Gloss (with missing item): ~~~for honour ACC ART people ___ go DIST to Tahiti
The English translation of this sentence is:‘...to honour the people who went to Tahiti.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another reason to consider the morpheme ___ as postnominal rather than postverbal, is that it co-occurs with the demonstrative tū, which is always accompanied by a postnominal de\-mon\-strative\is{Demonstrative!postnominal} (\sectref{sec:4.6.2.1}). When tū co-occurs with the morpheme ___ after the verb, this suggests that the verb has been raised.\footnote{\label{fn:519}Relative clause verbs may have a postverbal demonstrative\is{Demonstrative!postverbal}, even when the head noun also has a demonstrative; see \textit{nu{\ꞌ}u the morpheme ___ {\ob}oho the morpheme ___\,{\cb}} in \REF{ex:11.134}. Nevertheless, raised verbs never have a demonstrative of their own: two consecutive demonstratives\is{Demonstrative} never occur (\textit{*nu{\ꞌ}u {\ob}oho\,{\cb} the morpheme ___ {\ob}the morpheme ___\,{\cb}}). This can be accounted for by a rule deleting one of two consecutive demonstratives\is{Demonstrative}.} This is illustrated in \REF{ex:11.135} above; the same analysis can be extended to examples such as the following:
