Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The tendency to present events in the same order that they occur, common to languages in general, is very strong in Papuan languages. Consequently, there is a strong preference to present a cause clause before an effect clause (\citealt[409]{Haiman1980}, \citealt[59]{Roberts1987}, \citealt{Reesink1987}). In Mauwake consecutive coordination is the default, unmarked strategy for those sentences that express cause-effect or reason-result relationships\linebreak overt\-ly, because their structure follows this principle \REF{ex:8:x1400}, whereas in causal coordination sentences the effect is stated before the cause.

The English translation of this sentence is:`There is no forest near the village, because we have planted a lot of coconut palms.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The causal coordination is a very marked structure, which shows in the unusual ordering of the clauses: the causal clause follows rather than precedes the consequent clause. The causal clause in Mauwake begins with the connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{the morpheme ___} `its gloss ___' (\sectref{sec:3.11.2}), which is originally the interrogative word for `why'. There are two possible origins for this untypical structure. It may be a recent calque on the Tok Pisin causal construction, which uses \textstyleForeignWords{bilong wanem} `why/its gloss ___' as the connector and the same ordering of the two clauses. The ordering of the clauses shows that it may also have originated as an ``afterthought reason'',\footnote{The term suggested by Ger Reesink.} even though currently it is used when the cause or reason is emphasized \REF{ex:8:x1417}, \REF{ex:8:x1420}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The causal coordination is a very marked structure, which shows in the unusual ordering of the clauses: the causal clause follows rather than precedes the consequent clause. The causal clause in Mauwake begins with the connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{the morpheme ___} `its gloss ___' (\sectref{sec:3.11.2}), which is originally the interrogative word for `why'. There are two possible origins for this untypical structure. It may be a recent calque on the Tok Pisin causal construction, which uses \textstyleForeignWords{bilong wanem} `why/its gloss ___' as the connector and the same ordering of the two clauses. The ordering of the clauses shows that it may also have originated as an ``afterthought reason'',\footnote{The term suggested by Ger Reesink.} even though currently it is used when the cause or reason is emphasized \REF{ex:8:x1417}, \REF{ex:8:x1420}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Clause chaining in Mauwake distinguishes between sequential and simultaneous actions in the clauses joined by chaining, but only when the clauses have the same subject (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5.1}). The sequential action verb in \REF{ex:8:x1431} indicates that one action is finished before the next one starts.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He came and married me.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Simultaneity vs. sequentiality is not always a choice between absolutes; sometimes it is a relative matter. Example \REF{ex:8:x1433} refers to a situation where a man came back home from a period of labour elsewhere and got married upon arrival. In actual life, there may have been a time gap of at least a number of days, possibly longer, but because the two events were so closely linked in the speaker's mind, the simultaneous action form was used when the story was told decades after the events took place.

The English translation of this sentence is:`We eat, take the trap, wrap taro, take the the trap frame and spear(s) and go to the kunai grass area.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The simultaneous action form is less marked than the sequential action form: when the relative order of the actions or events is not relevant, the simultaneous action form is used. In example \REF{ex:8:x1437}, the order of the preparations for a pighunt is not crucial, but the sequential action form on the last medial verb indicates that all the actions take place before leaving, rather than just at the time of leaving.
A: word: en-ep-pu-ami	 gloss: eat-SS.SEQ-CMPL-SS.SIM

The English translation of this sentence is:`Later when you become a man and take a wife, what will you do?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A medial verb takes its temporal specification from the tense of the closest following finite clause \REF{ex:8:x1442}--\REF{ex:8:x1445}, or in the case of a right-dislocated medial clause, from the preceding finite clause \REF{ex:8:x1471}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The cargo was brought up (to the coast) by ship(s), and (then) trucks kept bringing it here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{ds}} medial verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5.2}) do not differentiate between sequential and simultaneous action. Sequential action \REF{ex:8:x1502} is the default interpretation for verbs other than \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be', which is interpreted as simultaneous with the verb in the reference clause \REF{ex:8:x1503}. So in order to specify that two or more actions by different participants took place at the same time, the speaker needs to use the continuous aspect form \REF{ex:8:x1472}:
A: word: p-urup-eya	 gloss: BPX-ascend-2/3s.DS
B: word: urup-eya	 gloss: rise-2/3s.DS

The English translation of this sentence is:`I had no money and I told him (or: Because I had no money I told him), ``I'll give it to you another time.'' '
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the chaining structure itself only specifies the temporal relationship between the clauses and is otherwise neutral, it is open especially for causal/consecutive interpretation. \citet[237]{Reesink1983b} notes this for different-subject medial verbs in Usan, and although not very common in Mauwake in general, it is more frequent with \textsc{ds} predicates \REF{ex:8:x1434}, \REF{ex:8:x1412} than with \textsc{ss} verbs.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They bring the son down (from the house) and take him (to the well) and (so) he bathes.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The causal/consecutive interpretation is most common when the object of a transitive medial clause becomes the subject in an intransitive reference clause: in example \REF{ex:8:x1504} `the son' is the object of the first two clauses and the subject of the final clause.
A: word: p-er-iwkin	 gloss: BPX-go-2/3p.DS

The English translation of this sentence is:`He understood the month and time/place that they (had) told him, and (so) he said, ``Now the Americans have come to fight.'' '
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cognition verbs and feeling or experiential verbs seem to be the only ones that allow a causal/consecutive interpretation when a medial clause has a \textsc{ss} verb \REF{ex:8:x1440}--\REF{ex:8:x1484}:
A: word: paayar-ep	 gloss: understand-SS.SEQ

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a singular subject changes into a plural there is more variation. First person singular changing into plural calls for same-subject marking \REF{ex:8:x1435}, but second person singular switching into first person plural requires different-subject marking even when this second person singular is part of the group denoted by the first person plural \REF{ex:8:x1439}.

The English translation of this sentence is: `Later we (by) ourselves will come up and tell you (to come), and when you come down we will sit here together and eat a bit of something and then you (can) walk back.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a second person plural switches into a first person plural (including the people indicated by the 2p), the marking has to be for different subject, but in the opposite case, the first person plural changing into the second person plural (again included in the 1p), the marking can be either for same or different subject. Both of these are exemplified in \REF{ex:8:x248}. Here the switch from first person plural to second person plural is marked with the \textsc{ss} marking.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ maa eka saanar-em-ik-eya iki(w-e)p eka un-ep ekap-ep amina=pa feef-am-ik-e-mik.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ food water dry-SS.SIM-be-2/3s.DS go-SS.SEQ water draw-SS.SEQ come-SS.SEQ pot=LOC pour-SS.SIM-be-PA-1/3p
The English translation of this sentence is:`They were cooking it and the soup kept drying and they kept going and drawing water and coming and pouring it in the pot.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Competition between a more topical subject with a less topical one most commonly occurs when a clause with an inanimate subject intervenes between clauses where there is an animate/human subject. Even here the ``normal'' \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{sr}} strategy is used, if the inanimate subject is topical enough to control the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{sr}} marking in the same way as animate subjects do.

Question 127:
You are a linguist specializing in Mauwake. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Sentence (with missing item): Aria maa en-ep naap ___ kokom-ar-eya in-e-mik.
Gloss (with missing item): alright food eat-SS.SEQ thus ___ dark-INCH-2/3s.DS sleep-PA-1/3p
The English translation of this sentence is:`Alright we ate and stayed like that and (then) it became dark and we slept.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When an inanimate subject is low in terms of topicality, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{sr}} marking of the previous clause disregards it and indicates same-subject continuation, but the verb in the inanimate clause has to indicate a change of subject, if a more topical subject follows. This structure in many Papuan languages is typical of temporal and climate expressions and other impersonal predications (\citealt{Reesink1983a}, \citealt{Roberts1988b}), which are often used for giving backgrounded\footnote{\citet[244]{Farr1999} calls this on-line background to distinguish it from the off-line background information of subordinate clauses.} information. In examples \REF{ex:8:x1482} and \REF{ex:8:x1475} the verb in the initial medial clause predicating the action of human participants is marked with same subject following even when the following clause mentions the coming of darkness or dawn. Returning to the main line action requires different-subject marking. In the examples, the ``skipped'' medial clauses are in brackets.
A: word: ik-ok	 gloss: be-SS
B: word: mauw-am-ik-ok	 gloss: work-SS.SIM-be-SS

Sentence (with missing item): Kir-ep ___ epa wiim-o-k.
Gloss (with missing item): turn-SS.SEQ ___ place dawn-PA-3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`They turned and as they were coming, it dawned.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If the impersonal predicate is important for the main story line, rather than providing backgrounded information, the impersonal verb itself is placed as a final verb, and the verb in the preceding medial clause is marked for different subject \REF{ex:8:x1492}. \citet[206]{Reesink1987} notes a similar rule for Usan.
A: word: ekap-em-ika-iwkin	 gloss: come-SS.SIM-be-2/3p.DS

Sentence (with missing item): Uuw-ap ___ oona=ke efa sirir-i-ya.
Gloss (with missing item): work-SS.SEQ ___ bone=QF 1s.ACC hurt-NC-PR.3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`I worked and worked and my bones hurt.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In many Papuan languages, the impersonal predications include a number of experiential verbs (\citealt[204]{Reesink1987}, \citealt{Roberts1997}). In Mauwake, most of the experiential expressions are adjunct plus verb constructions (\sectref{sec:3.8.5.2.1}), where the experiencer is a subject rather than an object; in chained clauses these behave in a regular manner. But those few experiential expressions that are impersonal do not trigger \textsc{ds} marking in the preceding medial clause, because the inanimate subject in the experiential clause is not topical enough to do it. In \REF{ex:8:x1491}, the first person singular subject of the medial clauses becomes the object of the final clause, but the medial clause has same subject marking:
A: word: uuw-ap	 gloss: work-SS.SEQ
B: word: suuw-ap	 gloss: push-SS.SEQ
C: word: on-ap	 gloss: do-SS.SEQ
D: word: aaw-emi	 gloss: take-SS.SIM

The English translation of this sentence is:`I cooked it and when it was finished, all right, I put (aside) a little of the meat for these two (women).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{weeser}- `finish' is often used in chained clauses to indicate the finishing of an action. In this function, its low-topicality subject, the nominalized form of the preceding verb, is never mentioned overtly, and the preceding medial clause has \textsc{ss} marking \REF{ex:8:x1483}:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A medial verb with \textsc{ds} marking is used in two instances where it does not indicate a change of subject. Both types have two or more clauses with identical \textsc{ds} marking even though the subject is the same; only the last of those clauses really indicates a change of subject. One of them is recursion of a \textsc{ds} verb \REF{ex:8:x1493}, indicating continuity; the identification of the subject is suspended until the repetition ends \citep[201]{Reesink1987}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The repeated verb retains its arguments, but its gloss ___ is a choice in how overtly they and the peripherals are marked in the medial clause. Retaining them makes the medial clause more emphatic, and the first element becomes a theme for the new sentence (\sectref{sec:9.1}). In \REF{ex:8:x1505} only the verbs are copied; \REF{ex:8:x1506} copies the subject as well, \REF{ex:8:x1507} the object and \REF{ex:8:x1508} the locative adverbial.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Olas came and threw a spear for him. He threw it but no, he missed.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most commonly the derivational morphology in the two verbs is identical, but sometimes the derivation in the finite verb is dropped from the medial verb \REF{ex:8:x1513}, \REF{ex:8:x1514}. In \REF{ex:8:x1513}, there is a good reason for dropping the benefactive marking from the repeated verb: the spear was thrown for someone's benefit, but it missed, and consequently there was no benefit for anyone.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In typological terms, relative clauses in Mauwake are mostly replacive, also called internal \REF{ex:8:x1529}--\REF{ex:8:x1546}. A normal finite clause is made into a noun phrase by the addition of the demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain}, and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{relnp}} inside the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{rc}} replaces the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{antnp}}. Pre-nominal \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{rc}s,} where the\textstyleAcronymallcaps{ \textsc{rc}} precedes the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{antnp},} are cross-linguistically more typical of \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{ov}} languages than replacive ones \citep[144]{Keenan1985}, but the latter are also common in Papuan languages (\citealt[229]{Reesink1983b} and \citealt[219]{Reesink1987}, \citealt[49]{Roberts1987}, \citealt[281]{Farr1999}, \citealt[193]{Whitehead2004}).
