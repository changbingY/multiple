Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): N-bu-rótu konó ___ N-bu-rótu nénja
Gloss (with missing item): COP-NP14-good but ___ COP-NP14-good well
The English translation of this sentence is:‘It is good, but it is not very good.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The auxiliary ri ‘be’ with a negative prefix is also used to negate nominal predicates. Affirmative nominal predicates are marked by a copulative prefix only (see \sectref{bkm:Ref489963307}). When negated with the auxiliary ri, the copulative prefix is maintained, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref99104807}--\ref{bkm:Ref99104808}).
A: word: ka-rí	 gloss: NEG-be
B: word: ka-réː	 gloss: ADV-long
C: word: ka-i-oːr-é̲sek-i	 gloss: NEG-SM9-can-NEUT-NEG
D: word: n-bu-rótu	 gloss: COP-NP14-good
Please only return the letter (A–D).
