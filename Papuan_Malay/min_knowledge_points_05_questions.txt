You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation.

Gloss (with missing item): ... 1SG bathe at L.MED at L.MED ___ maybe jackfruit
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[I saw (the poles),] I bathed there, there where (there are) maybe jackfruits’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The pronominally used locatives can be modified with demonstratives or relative clauses. Modification with the demonstratives typically involves short distal \textitbf{tu} ‘\textsc{d.dist}’ as in (\ref{Example_5.226}), while \isi{modification} with long distal \textitbf{itu} ‘\textsc{d.dist}’ is only attested for the non-proximal locatives, as in \textitbf{sana itu} ‘over there (\textsc{emph})’ in (\ref{Example_5.227}). These distributional patterns still require further investigation. Modification with proximal \textitbf{ini} ‘\textsc{d.prox}’ is unattested but possible, as shown in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.228}). Modification with relative clauses is also possible, as illustrated for proximal \textitbf{sini} ‘\textsc{l.prox}’ in (\ref{Example_5.229}) and medial \textitbf{situ} ‘\textsc{l.med}’ in (\ref{Example_5.230}). In the corpus, however, such \isi{modification} is rare and unattested for distal \textitbf{sana} ‘\textsc{l.dist}’.

In prehead position of countable referents, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several, how many’ questions the absolute numbers of items denoted by the head nominals, as in (\ref{Example_5.282}). In posthead position of countable referents, it questions unique positions within series, as in (\ref{Example_5.283}). When following mass nouns, the \isi{interrogative} questions the nonnumeric amounts of its referents, as in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.284}). Like other quantifiers, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several, how many’ is unattested in prehead position of mass nouns. If the referent’s identity is known from the context, the head nominal can be omitted, as with numerals and other quantifiers. This is illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.285}), where the omitted head is \textitbf{rupia} ‘rupiah’. (Details on numerals and quantifiers are given in §\ref{Para_5.9} and §\ref{Para_5.10}, respectively.)

Question 558:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ko minta minyak ___ banyak?
Gloss (with missing item): 2PL request oil ___ many
The English translation of this sentence is:‘how much oil do you request’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most often, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___, how many’ functions as a nominal modifier which takes the position of the \isi{numeral} or \isi{quantifier} it replaces. Corresponding to the syntax of adnominally used numerals and quantifiers, it precedes or follows its head nominal, as in (\ref{Example_5.282}) to (\ref{Example_5.284}). In prehead position of countable referents, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___, how many’ questions the absolute numbers of items denoted by the head nominals, as in (\ref{Example_5.282}).

This \isi{noun} phrase ``\textitbf{nomor} Num'' gives the ordinal reading ``Num-th'' such as \textitbf{nomor the morpheme ___} ‘third’ in (\ref{Example_5.306}) or \textitbf{nomor empat} ‘fourth’ in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.307}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘(there) is a certain younger sibling there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to its enumerating function in postposed position, adnominally used \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ is employed to encode “specific \isi{indefiniteness}”, using Crystal’s (\citeyear*[444]{Crystal.2008}) terminology. That is, in \textsc{nn}um-\textsc{np}s adnominal \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ denotes specific but nonidentifiable referents, giving the specific \isi{indefinite} reading \textscItal{n} \textitbf{satu} ‘a certain \textsc{n}’. The specific \isi{indefinite} referent may be animate human such as \textitbf{the morpheme ___ satu} ‘a certain younger sibling’ in (\ref{Example_5.312}) or inanimate such as \textitbf{kampung satu} ‘a certain village’ in (\ref{Example_5.313}).

Sentence (with missing item): ___ jam
Gloss (with missing item): ___ hour
The English translation of this sentence is:‘half an hour’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Noun phrases with adnominal quantifiers have syntactic properties similar to those with adnominal numerals, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.314}) to (\ref{Example_5.322}). Noun phrases with prehead quantifiers (``\textsc{q}t\textsc{n-np}'') express nonnumeric amounts or quantities of the items indicated by their head nominals. Thereby, the composite nature of countable referents is accentuated. Posthead quantifiers, by contrast, may denote exhaustivity of \isi{indefinite} referents or signal unknown positions within series or sequences; they modify countable as well as uncountable referents.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ jam
Gloss (with missing item): ___ hour
The English translation of this sentence is:‘half an hour’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The data in (\ref{Example_5.314}) to (\ref{Example_5.322}) shows that not all quantifiers occur in all positions. Only five quantifiers occur in either pre- or posthead position, namely \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’, \textitbf{masing-masing} ‘each’, \textitbf{sedikit} ‘few’, and \textitbf{smua} ‘all’. While \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’, \textitbf{sedikit} ‘few’, and \textitbf{smua} ‘all’ can modify both count and mass nouns, \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’ and \textitbf{masing-masing} ‘each’ only modify count nouns. The remaining four quantifiers occur in prehead position only, namely \textitbf{segala} ‘all’, \textitbf{sembarang} ‘any (kind of)’, \textitbf{(se)tiap} ‘every’, and \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’. These quantifiers modify count nouns only.
