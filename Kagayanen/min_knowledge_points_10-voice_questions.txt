Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Nanligan i ___ din bata daw ...-batang-an ta waig a ulo ta bata. Tapos pa-garay-an din.\\
Gloss (with missing item): midwife DEF.N ___ 3S.ERG child and T.R-put-APL NABS water INJ head NABS child then T.R-chant-APL 3S.ERG
The English translation of this sentence is:`As for the midwife, she holds the child and puts some water on the head of the child. Then she chants (for the child).’ (This is a naming ceremony for newborn babies similar to baptism.)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref118204569} illustrates three applicative constructions. The first applicative involves the root ibit ‘hold’, which is a member of the class of roots that always appear in an applicative form when transitive (Class VIII). All such roots involve a patient that does not undergo a change in state, but is only slightly, superficially or invisibly affected by the action of the verb. In this case, the act of holding a child does not change or affect the child in any substantive way, and thus the child shares the semantic feature of “superficial affectedness” with locations. \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}, \sectref{sec:volitionaltransitiveroots} contains a long list of such roots. In the second applicative in \REF{bkm:Ref118204569}, the location of the placing of water is the head of the child, which appears in the absolutive. Finally, in the third applicative, the absolutive argument of the stem garayan ‘to chant for’ is ellipted because the child is the main topic in this stretch of text, and in the context it is clear that the midwife chants for the child.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ din bayo din ya ta bļawan…
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG shirt 3S.GEN DEF.F NABS gold
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He filled up his shirt with gold...’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref500573274} and \REF{bkm:Ref500573276} have the same argument structure--an Actor in the ergative case and a patient in the absolutive, therefore they are both patient voice. The difference is that \REF{bkm:Ref500573274} is a simple transitive construction, while \REF{bkm:Ref500573276} is an applicative. The meaning of \REF{bkm:Ref500573276} is that the Actor did not cut the wood completely in two parts, but only cut off a small portion. The following examples, repeated here from \chapref{chap:verbstructure}, also illustrate the partitive use of the applicative. Example \REF{bkm:Ref395171869} illustrates the verb panno ‘fill’ in a non-applicative construction. In this example, the shirt is the absolutive, while the Actor, ‘he’ is ergative:
A: word: pa-panno	 gloss: T.R-fill

The English translation of this sentence is:‘He filled part way his shirt with gold.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref395171874v} illustrates the same verb in an applicative construction. Note, however, that the argument structure is the same. The shirt is still absolutive, and the Actor is still ergative:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he let/caused the papaya to decay.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As with all semantically transitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} verbs, causative verb stems can appear in a Detransitive (Actor voice) construction. In this case, the pa{}- causative does appear with some verbs (such as lunot `decay' in example \ref{bkm:Ref501112712}) but not with others (such as pudpod, ‘crumble into powder’ in example \ref{bkm:Ref329259219}):

Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ kanen an ta buļong.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ABS DEF.M NABS medicine
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he is/was crumbling medicine into powder.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We know that \REF{bkm:Ref329259219} is a detransitive of a causative construction and not a simple intransitive construction because a) the absolutive pronoun refers to a person, and persons don’t (normally) crumble into powder, and b) the understanding is that the medicine is what crumbles, with the absolutive argument referring to a causal agent.
A: word: ga-pudpod	 gloss: I.R-crumble.into.powder

Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ din ki yaken baybay an ta mga batang.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG OBL.P 1s beach DEF.M NABS PL driftwood
The English translation of this sentence is:`S/he will make me let some driftwood wash ashore on the beach.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We know that the pa{}- prefix is a causative, and the modality is irrealis in \REF{bkm:Ref501176811} because of the argument structure. The presence of an oblique argument, ki yaken, makes it clear that this is a double causative. The absence of an overt transitivity marker on the verb indicates that this must be irrealis modality (recall that the presence of the applicative -an precludes the use of the transitive irrealis suffix -en, thus leaving “zero” as the only indicator of transitivity). If the pa{}- in this example were the transitive realis pa{}-, the only possible reading would be “You brought the driftwood to the beach at me,” and such a meaning is impossible.
