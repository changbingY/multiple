Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ garda b=y\stem{fn}nza.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ canoe(ABS) MED=STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:IPFV/hit.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The spirit was hitting (against) the canoe there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nouns are distinct from other \isi{nominal}s in being the only lexical items which trigger \isi{gender} agreement. The agreement target is the third \isi{person} singular prefix of the verb ({\S}\ref{gender-subsec}). The semantics of the \isi{gender} system is described in the following section ({\S}\ref{gender-system-sec}). Additionally, nouns trigger \isi{number} agreement, in this they resemble other \isi{nominal} subclasses such as pronouns. The agreement target for \isi{number} depends on the type of argument, but it involves three distinct verbal affix slots (the \isi{undergoer} prefix, the actor suffix, and the duality marker). The verb morphology will be laid out in chapter \ref{cha:verb morphology}, but we get a glimpse of the agreement system in examples (\ref{ex044}-\ref{ex047}).
A: word: brbr=f	 gloss: spirit=ERG.SG
B: word: brbr=nzo	 gloss: spirit=ONLY
C: word: nzürna	 gloss: spirit

The English translation of this sentence is:`Then they send the word to us ... to the Mayawas in Rouku ... to there ... to Masu.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nominal \isi{number} marking takes place on the level of the \isi{noun phrase}, leaving aside the use of numerals. Nominal \isi{number} marking is underspecified for three reasons. First, only animates are marked for \isi{number}, especially humans. Example (\ref{ex494}) shows the \isi{allative} \isi{case} marker on several \isi{nominal}s, and only the \isi{animate} referents are marked for \isi{number}. Note that the spatial cases (\isi{locative}, \isi{allative}, \isi{ablative}) have special formatives for \isi{animate} referents ({\S}\ref{spatialcase}). Secondly, \isi{number} marking on the \isi{noun} only occurs when the respective \isi{noun phrase} is flagged with a \isi{case} marker. Thus, nouns out of syntactic context or \isi{noun phrases} in the \isi{absolutive} \isi{case}, which is \isi{zero}, have no \isi{nominal} \isi{number} marking. Thirdly, \isi{nominal} \isi{number} marking is based on a \isi{singular} versus \isi{non-singular} distinction.\footnote{The associative case is an exception. With animate referents it is used for the inclusory construction ({\S}\ref{inclusorycontruction}), and there the values are dual and plural, instead of singular and non-singular.} The full three-way distinction between \isi{singular}, \isi{dual} and \isi{plural} is encoded in the \isi{verb}. It follows that the majority of nouns or \isi{noun phrase}s are underspecified for \isi{number}, and for core \isi{case} arguments, \isi{number} is assigned morpho-syntactically via the agreement system of the verb.

Sentence (with missing item): fi ___ woku-thé ya\stem{r}a.
Gloss (with missing item): Third.ABS ___ skin-Adlzr TSG.MASC:SBJ:PST:IPFV/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He was a bit boyish.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In order to derive adjectives, some nouns take the \isi{adjectivaliser} suffix -thé. We can see this most clearly in the colour terms: kwayanthé `white' from kwayan `light' or frkthé `red' from frk `blood'. The productivity of -thé is rather limited and there are a number of lexical items which show frozen morphology. For example, yfrsé `black' from yfr `Syzygium sp' (used for black paint) shows an irregular variant, -sé instead of -thé. For dbömsé `blunt' there is no corresponding \isi{noun} without the suffix. The restrictions in terms of productivity can be explained by the presence of a class of property nouns to be discussed in {\S}\ref{propertynouns-sec}. There is an alternative strategy for deriving colour and shape adjectives. This involves the formation of a compound with the word woku `skin' which takes the \isi{adjectivaliser} suffix. The Komnzo equivalent for \ili{English} `green' is expressed by wämne taga wokuthé (lit. `tree leaf skin-like') or the translation of `round' is aki wokuthé (lit. `moon skin-like'). An example of this strategy is given in (\ref{ex509}), where the speaker characterises a man as looking a bit `boyish'.
A: word: srak-srak	 gloss: REDUP-boy

Gloss (with missing item): ___ canoe(ABS) MED=STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:IPFV/hit.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The spirit was hitting (against) the canoe there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All common nouns can serve as the host for \isi{case} clitics (\isi{ergative}, \isi{dative}, \isi{possessive}, \isi{locative}, \isi{allative}, \isi{ablative}, \isi{instrumental}, \isi{characteristic}, \isi{purposive}, \isi{associative}, \isi{proprietive}, \isi{privative}, \isi{similative}) or receive other \isi{nominal} morphology (\isi{exclusive}, \isi{emphatic}). As I describe in {\S}\ref{formfunccase}, \isi{case} markers operate at the level of the \isi{noun phrase}. Noun phrases headed by a \isi{noun} can function as arguments or adjuncts, as well as complements of the copula. This is illustrated by the \isi{ergative} and absolutive-marked arguments in example (\ref{ex044}).\footnote{The absolutive case is zero-marked in singular, and the non-singular formative -é is rare throughout the corpus.

You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ ni fä nzwa\stem{m}nzrm.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ FNSG DIST FPL:SBJ:PST:DUR/dwell.
The English translation of this sentence is:`We were staying in Masu over there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All common nouns can serve as the host for \isi{case} clitics (\isi{ergative}, \isi{dative}, \isi{possessive}, \isi{locative}, \isi{allative}, \isi{ablative}, \isi{instrumental}, \isi{characteristic}, \isi{purposive}, \isi{associative}, \isi{proprietive}, \isi{privative}, \isi{similative}) or receive other \isi{nominal} morphology (\isi{exclusive}, \isi{emphatic}). As I describe in {\S}\ref{formfunccase}, \isi{case} markers operate at the level of the \isi{noun phrase}. Noun phrases headed by a \isi{noun} can function as arguments or adjuncts, as well as complements of the copula. This is illustrated by the \isi{ergative} and absolutive-marked arguments in example (\ref{ex044}).\footnote{The absolutive case is zero-marked in singular, and the non-singular formative -é is rare throughout the corpus. In example (\ref{ex044}), the word garda `canoe' is glossed with the absolutive case in brackets. Note that for most examples in this grammar, I do not gloss the absolutive if it is zero-marked. Exceptions are those examples, where the case value is important for the decription.} Example (\ref{ex045}) shows a locative-marked \isi{noun} which functions as an adjunct.
A: word: masu=n	 gloss: masu=LOC
B: word: masu	 gloss: masu
C: word: ŋanz=märe	 gloss: row=PRIV
D: word: ezi=thamar	 gloss: morning=TEMP.PURP

Question 16:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ŋatha=yé ___ kam] ya\stem{na}thrth.
Gloss (with missing item): dog=ERG.NSG ___ bone STPL:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/eat.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The dogs are chewing a wallaby bone.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nouns typically function as the \isi{head} of a \isi{noun phrase} or as the \isi{head} of a \isi{nominal} compound. Compounds are described in {\S}\ref{compounds-subsec}. Example (\ref{ex046}) shows the \isi{noun} waniwani `picture, shadow' as the \isi{head} of the noun phrase modified by the \isi{demonstrative} zane and the \isi{adjective} katan. Nouns may act as modifiers within a noun phrase. In the \isi{nominal} compound in (\ref{ex047}) the two nouns act as \isi{head} (kam `bone') and \isi{modifier} (the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___'). In the examples NPs are marked off by [].
A: word: tauri	 gloss: wallaby
B: word: tauri=fo	 gloss: wallaby=All
C: word: rouku	 gloss: rouku
D: word: rthé=thamane	 gloss: when=TEMP.POSS

Question 17:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ \stem{yé}.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ TSGMASC:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is hungry.' \uline{not:} `It is hunger.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note that with \isi{intransitive} verbs, like the copula, property nouns function as \isi{nominal} predicates. A clause like (\ref{ex031}) can only be interpreted as having an omitted \isi{subject} noun phrase which is third person singular masculine. It cannot be analysed in a way that the morpheme ___ `hunger' is the argument of the copula.
A: word: frasi	 gloss: hungry
B: word: frasi=nzo	 gloss: hunger=ONLY
C: word: nz-rä-kor-∅	 gloss: FNSG.BET-IRR.NDU-speak.RS-STSG
D: word: kabe	 gloss: man
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Question 18:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ \stem{yé}.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ TSGMASC:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is hungry.' \uline{not:} `It is hunger.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Hence, we could say that property nouns escape indexation in the \isi{undergoer} prefix and as a consequence there is no \isi{gender} agreement. If informants are asked directly whether a given \isi{noun} is \isi{feminine} or \isi{masculine}, they can answer this promptly, but with property nouns, they hesitate and often answer: ``it depends''. In an example like (\ref{ex031}), it depends on the intended meaning: `she is its gloss ___' or `he is its gloss ___'. Thus, it depends on the \isi{gender} of the referent indexed in the copula, not on the \isi{property noun}.
A: word: frasi	 gloss: hungry
B: word: frasi=nzo	 gloss: hunger=ONLY
C: word: bafane	 gloss: Recog.POSS.SG
D: word: twof	 gloss: heat

The English translation of this sentence is:`It crawled here to this place. That is when it got stuck right here.' (lit. `Hardness did it.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Secondly, property nouns indexed in the actor suffix trigger a default \isi{singular} \isi{number} agreement. This occurs in \isi{experiencer-object} constructions (\ref{ex035}) or in the \isi{middle} template (\ref{ex040}). In (\ref{ex035}), the \isi{property noun} thkar `hardness' is flagged with the \isi{ergative} \isi{case}, and it is indexed in the suffix of the verb fiyoksi `make'. This example is from a myth in which a crocodile creates a large pool of water, because it got stuck, which translates literally as `hardness made it'. In (\ref{ex040}), the \isi{property noun} twof `heat' is in the absolutive \isi{case}, and it is indexed in the suffix of the middle verb sogsi `ascend'. In both examples, the indexed person/\isi{number} value is \Stsg. See {\S}\ref{expobjconstr} for \isi{experiencer-object} constructions and {\S}\ref{middletemplatesubsection} for a description of the middle template.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Its heat rose up to the sky.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex040}) shows that property nouns can enter into a \isi{possessive} construction. This is another characteristic they share with nouns and which sets them apart from adjectives. In this case, the morpheme ___ is the \isi{possessed}. Although there are no examples attested in the corpus where a \isi{property noun} is the \isi{possessor}, this is confirmed by data from elicitation.

The English translation of this sentence is:`She started sweet-talking him: ``Will you go back? The sun is already setting!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to \isi{nominal} modification, property nouns can have a coverb function. Property nouns may occur with light verbs (rä- `do', fiyoksi `make', ko- `become') or phasal verbs (thkäfsi `start', bthaksi `finish'). In (\ref{ex041}), a malevolent spirit is trying to lure a traveller to stay the night at her camp. In the construction, the \isi{property noun} the morpheme ___ `sweet talk' expresses most of the semantics of the event while the phasal verb thkäfksi `start' takes the inflection and indexing.
A: word: garamgaram	 gloss: sweet.talk

The English translation of this sentence is:`She started sweet-talking him: ``Will you go back? The sun is already setting!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Coverb + \isi{light verb} constructions of this kind have been described for a number of Australian languages. For example, in \ili{Jaminjung} (\citealt{SchultzeBerndt:2000wk}) or \ili{Bilinarra} (\citealt{Meakins:ul}) we find a division of labour in complex predicates whereby a distinct \isi{word class} of coverbs contributes most of the meaning of an event while a \isi{light verb} carries most of the inflectional material. In Komnzo, there are a few property nouns which seem to be more event-oriented in their semantics. However, there is insufficient morphological or distributional evidence for setting up a distinct \isi{word class} of coverbs. In addition to the coverb function in example (\ref{ex041}), property nouns can be used as secondary predicates. An example is provided in the use of wri `intoxication' in (\ref{ex042}), where an angry man is tranquilised by giving him kava to drink.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They put him down with kava. Then he was lying down dead drunk.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Coverb + \isi{light verb} constructions of this kind have been described for a number of Australian languages. For example, in \ili{Jaminjung} (\citealt{SchultzeBerndt:2000wk}) or \ili{Bilinarra} (\citealt{Meakins:ul}) we find a division of labour in complex predicates whereby a distinct \isi{word class} of coverbs contributes most of the meaning of an event while a \isi{light verb} carries most of the inflectional material.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ STPL:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/grow like.this really EMPH TSG.MASC:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/grow.
The English translation of this sentence is:`They grow closely together. This one really grows like that.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Property nouns marked with the \isi{instrumental} \isi{case} have an adverbial function. In example (\ref{ex033}), the \isi{property noun} ktkt `narrow' is the single argument of the intransitive verb. In the text, a group of headhunters prepare to attack a hamlet. The sentence is accompanied by a gesture which resembles the movement of the arms as if embracing a person. Here ktkt is does not function as a secondary predicate and it would be incorrect to translate it as `They became narrow'. Note that the verb indexes \Stsg{} and not \Stnsg{}. Hence, a more literal translation is adequate `narrowness became/happened' or with a dummy \isi{subject} `it became narrow'. In example (\ref{ex034}), the same \isi{property noun} ktkt takes the instrumental \isi{case} and functions adverbially. Here the speaker explains how the plant grnzari (Chantium sp) grows.
A: word: ktkt=me	 gloss: narrow=INS
B: word: kt-kt=me	 gloss: REDUP-group=INS
C: word: katan=me	 gloss: small=INS

The English translation of this sentence is:`When the fish tries to get out, the small (basket) will bring them back here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Adjectives may serve as the host for any \isi{case} enclitic if they occur in the rightmost position of the noun phrase. This occurs if (i) the \isi{head} of noun phrase has been omitted as in (\ref{ex048}) or (ii) if an \isi{adjective} has been postposed, as in (\ref{ex049}). See {\S}\ref{headslot} for further discussion of headedness and \isi{ellipsis}. Example (\ref{ex505}) shows an \isi{adjective} preceding the \isi{head} of the \isi{noun phrase}. We see from these examples, combined with the argument of \isi{ellipsis}, that adjectives cannot function as the \isi{head} of a phrase. This is supported by the observation that it is the \isi{head} of a phrase which triggers agreement in the verb prefix and not the \isi{adjective}.
A: word: katan=f	 gloss: small=ERG

The English translation of this sentence is:`Tayafe, you walk in a bad way! (Watch out) for snakes!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As with property nouns, adjectives with an \isi{instrumental} \isi{case} can function adverbially. In (\ref{ex050}), the \isi{adjective} gathagatha `bad' modifies the verb. In the example, a mother is scolding her daughter because she walks carelessly through the long grass. In (\ref{ex043}), the adjective katan `small' modifies the predicate `be rotten'. In this procedural text, the speaker demonstrates how to roll a little whistle from a coconut leaf. However, the first attempt to blow the whistle fails because the coconut leaf was not fresh.

In (\ref{ex043}), the adjective katan `small' modifies the predicate `be rotten'. In this procedural text, the speaker demonstrates how to roll a little whistle from a coconut leaf. However, the first attempt to blow the whistle fails because the coconut leaf was not fresh.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{distributive} and the instrumental may also be suffixed to the same \isi{quantifier}. In this case, their order is fixed: the instrumental follows the \isi{distributive}, as shown in example (\ref{ex080}). The example also shows that, like other \isi{nominal}s, quantifiers can be reduplicated to indicate plurality. Here, the speaker talks about types of bows and how different men use these according to their abilities and preferences.

The English translation of this sentence is:`We are not many old people ... just a few.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note in passing that in (\ref{ex081})\footnote{\label{foot1}In example (\ref{ex081}) we can see that tüfr `plenty' precedes the reduplicated adjective kafarkafar `big'. The example is interpreted to have an elided noun kabe `man' as its head, thus kafarkafar means `the big ones'. This then constitutes a corpus example of a quantifier preceding its head.} the \isi{quantifier} tüfr `plenty' is negated by using the \isi{privative} case =mär. This is also possible with etha.
A: word: tüfr=mär	 gloss: plenty=PRIV

The English translation of this sentence is:`We are not many old people ... just a few.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Beyond the observation of cultural practices, evidence for this double system comes from the lexical items themselves. In everyday counting, the words for `two' and `three' are eda and etha. In ritualised counting, the words are yda and ytho respectively. The latter pair reflects older forms which have not undergone the loss of word-initial y. This sound change (jə > e /#_) is attested in many pairs of lexical items between Komnzo and the neighbouring \ili{Tonda} varieties, e.g. \ili{Wära} ymoth `girl' corresponds to Komnzo emoth. Another piece of evidence comes from the fact that the numeral etha `three' can also mean `a few' (\ref{ex081}). I take this as evidence for the fuzzy upper limit of the restricted set.
A: word: tüfr=mär	 gloss: plenty=PRIV
B: word: tüfr=märe	 gloss: plenty=PRIV
C: word: watik-thé=mär	 gloss: enough-Adlzr=PRIV

The English translation of this sentence is:`Only some people for themselves ... only they held that knowledge.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Numerals can take the same morphology as quantifiers ({\S}\ref{quantifiers-subsec}). There are no corpus examples of a numeral taking either the \isi{distributive} suffix or the instrumental \isi{case} clitic, but example (\ref{ex082}) illustrates the use of both. I was taught the phrase näbikakme käznob! `drink it one by one!' before I administered pain relief tablets to my friends and informants. I was corrected whenever I falsely used only the instrumental näbime käznob, which means `drink it in one go!' (lit. `with one').

In the following examples, the \isi{temporal} \isi{purposive} \isi{case} is used on the noun ezi (\ref{ex057}), on the time adverbial nama and the \ili{English} \isi{loanword} `Friday' (\ref{ex055}), and on the \isi{temporal} adjective thrma (\ref{ex058}). In (\ref{ex057}), the speaker tells his friends to leave the work on a sago palm for the next day. In (\ref{ex055}), the speaker begins his description of a namesake ceremony which is about to be held two days later. Finally, in (\ref{ex058}), two speakers go through a set of stimulus pictures and try to sort them into a narrative.

The English translation of this sentence is:`What might the father be carrying?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cross-cutting the division of \isi{nominal}s is the subclass of interrogatives. These are roots used to indicate that the speaker does not know the (full) identity of a referent. Interrogatives belong to the following \isi{nominal} subclasses: pronouns (the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___', mä `where', mane `who, which', rma `why, for its gloss ___'), quantifiers (rnzam `how many'), tempothe morpheme ___ls (rthé `when') or interrogative adverbs (mon `how'). The degree to which these can be marked for case varies. Interrogatives may constitute a full \isi{noun phthe morpheme ___se} (\ref{ex507}) or fill the \isi{determiner} slot (\ref{ex508}) of a noun phthe morpheme ___se. In the following examples NPs are enclosed by square bthe morpheme ___ckets.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I will bring (the garden) up to the road, but when ... in which year (will I get there)?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Other interrogatives show a behaviour that aligns them with their respective \isi{nominal} subclass. The \isi{temporal} \isi{interrogative} rthé `when' may be marked for \isi{temporal} \isi{case}, for example rthéthamane `of what time' in (\ref{ex086}), where the speaker explains that he will move his garden plot closer to the road each year.

The English translation of this sentence is:`How you have learned Komnzo, she also knew it ... the Komnzo language.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{interrogative} \isi{adverb} mon `how' frequently occurs with an instrumental \isi{case} (=me). This is entirely optional and does not change its meaning (\ref{ex087}). Mon or monme are the interrogative counterpart to the manner demonstrative nima `this way' (\S\ref{manner-demonstrative-subsec}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`However many will pull ... four or five people? They will stand opposite and pull that one ... the wallaby skin.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{interrogative} \isi{quantifier} rnzam `how many, how much' occurs with a \isi{nominal} \isi{head}. It is possible for rnzam to be marked for case if it follows its \isi{head}. However, there are no occurrences of this in the corpus. (\ref{ex088}) shows an example where the \isi{nominal} \isi{head} (kabe `man') has been elided and consequently rnzam is flagged with the \isi{ergative} \isi{case}. In the example, the speaker explains how a piece of wallaby skin is glued onto a kundu drum.
A: word: rnzam=é	 gloss: how.many=ERG.NSG

Sentence (with missing item): wati ane ___ kayé thrä\stem{kor}th ft kabe.
Gloss (with missing item): well DEM ___ yesterday STPL:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:IRR:PFV/say ft people.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Sometimes they call those ones ``ft people''.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like the demonstratives ({\S}\ref{demonstratives-sec}), the \isi{indefinite} the morpheme ___ can stand alone and take a subset of \isi{case} clitics. These are the \isi{instrumental} (the morpheme ___me `with some other'), \isi{characteristic} (the morpheme ___ma `because of some other'), \isi{purposive} (the morpheme ___mr `for some other'), \isi{proprietive} (the morpheme ___karä `with some other'). More commonly the morpheme ___ functions as an \isi{indefinite} \isi{determiner}, as in the morpheme ___ kar `some, other place' \rightarrow `somewhere' or the morpheme ___ rokar `some, other stuff' \rightarrow `something' or the morpheme ___ kayé `some yesterday\textbar{}tomorrow' \rightarrow `sometime'. This can be extended to the morpheme ___ kabe `some, another man' \rightarrow `someone'. Two examples of the determiner use are given in (\ref{ex720}) and (\ref{ex500}). In the first example, the speaker just explained that it is possible to `borrow a sister' for exchange marriage from a clan, with whom one shares a land boundary. In the second example, he talks about tall posts, which were used to show off a clan's success in competitive yam cultivation.

The English translation of this sentence is:`As for Masu, there was another post planted over there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like the demonstratives ({\S}\ref{demonstratives-sec}), the \isi{indefinite} the morpheme ___ can stand alone and take a subset of \isi{case} clitics. These are the \isi{instrumental} (the morpheme ___me `with some other'), \isi{characteristic} (the morpheme ___ma `because of some other'), \isi{purposive} (the morpheme ___mr `for some other'), \isi{proprietive} (the morpheme ___karä `with some other').

Sentence (with missing item): zokwasi=mär ŋa\stem{fiyok}wa ... ___ nä zokwasi.
Gloss (with missing item): word=PRIV STSG:SBJ:PST:IPFV/make ... ___ INDF words.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He was speechless ... no words whatsoever'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Negative indefinites are expressed by adding the \isi{negator} the morpheme ___. Thus, nä zokwasi means `some words', but if negated by the morpheme ___ it expresses `no words whatsoever'. This is the way how the speaker describes the shameful reaction of one of the characters in (\ref{ex501}).
A: word: keke	 gloss: NEG

Gloss (with missing item): ___ who INDF TSG.MASC:SBJ:PST:IPFV:VENIT/walk arrow pull.out-NMLZ=PURP EMPH.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Nobody came to pull out that arrow.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Negative indefinites can also be constructed with interrogatives. This is a strategy attested in many languages (\citealt{Haspelmath:1997indefinite}, \citealt{wals-115}). Thus, the concept of `nobody' can be expressed by kabe nä the morpheme ___ (lit. `people some not') or with an \isi{interrogative}, for example mane nä the morpheme ___ (lit. `who some not'). The order of elements is somewhat fixed in that the \isi{indefinite} always follows the \isi{interrogative}. In example (\ref{ex697}), the speaker describes a ritual, whereby an arrow is shot into a tree trunk to mark a particular woman for marriage.
A: word: keke	 gloss: NEG

The English translation of this sentence is:`She hid away (the fire) ... no one knew ... she told them nothing. Only she knew.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example (\ref{ex719}), the speaker talks about tütü `Pheasant Coucal', who was the guardian of fire before its gloss ___ knew about its existence. The first token of nä has scope over the morpheme ___ miyatha (`its gloss ___ knowledge') and literally means `no its gloss ___'s knowledge whatsoever'. The second token of nä is with the interrogative ra (what.{\Abs}) and literally means `she made them knowledgeable about nothing'.
A: word: kabe	 gloss: people

The English translation of this sentence is:`However many will pull ... four or five people? They will stand opposite and pull that one ... the wallaby skin.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Positive indefinites are expressed without the use of nä. Instead, the \isi{particle} thzé `ever' is postposed to an \isi{interrogative}, resulting in ra thzé `whatever', mane thzé `whoever, whichever'. An example with rnzam `how many' was shown in (\ref{ex088}). An example with maf `who' is given in (\ref{ex089}), where the speaker has just shown be a particular, but then leaves it on the path.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Mabata stayed as a widow. She was that one's widow ... Masen's widow.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex093}) is a first mention of a particular person in a narrative. Although not required, it is quite common for the speaker to fill in the `missing' referent after a short lapse. Thus, the phrase masenane mezü `Masen's widow' refers back to bafane mezü `that one's widow'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Mabata stayed as a widow. She was that one's widow ... Masen's widow.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{recognitional} \isi{demonstrative} is built on the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative}, as we can tell by the initial consonant b. It follows that the \isi{recognitional} must have emerged through semantic extension from the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative}, and only later developed distinct forms for all the cases. We find that a number of forms serve a double function. For example, bäne can function as \isi{demonstrative} \isi{pronoun} (`that') and as \isi{recognitional} \isi{pronoun} (`the one I presume that you know about'). But the two differ in their combinatorics. While the \isi{demonstrative} can modify as well as replace a \isi{nominal} \isi{head} of a phrase, the \isi{recognitional} operates only pronominally. I have already shown in example (\ref{ex093}) that it is quite common for a speaker to fill in the intended referent of a \isi{recognitional} herself, sometimes after the clause, sometimes after a short pause. This leaves us with the problem of distinguishing the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative} from the \isi{recognitional} in a phrase like bäne kabe. However, prosody signals which of the two it is. If both words belong to the same intonation contour, it is the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative}: `that man'. If there is short break in the intonation or a longer pause, it is the \isi{recognitional}: `that one ... the man'. The other \isi{case} forms which are formally identical are impossible to distinguish in a clear way. For example, bänema `therefore, because' is often used to connect another clause ({\S}\ref{pronominal-demonstratives-subsec}). In this case we always find a break in the intonation. It is best to interpret the formal identity as a signal of the semantic extension of the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative}. That being said, it would be wrong to conclude that the \isi{recognitional} is merely a function of the \isi{medial} \isi{demonstrative}.

Question 86:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ruga ŋan\stem{kwir}a ___ san\stem{kuk}a bä b=\stem{yé}.
Gloss (with missing item): pig STSG:SBJ:PST:IPFV:VENIT/run ___ TSG.MASC:SBJ:PST:PFV:VENIT/stand MED MED=TSG.MASC:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The pig came running, and he stood like this over there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Komnzo has a manner \isi{demonstrative} the morpheme ___ which is best translated as `like this' or `do this way'. In some languages this demonstrative is assigned to the class of verbs, for example in \ili{Boumaa Fijian} and \ili{Dyirbal} (\citealt[72]{Dixon:2003dj}). In other languages it is a \isi{nominal}, for example in \ili{Kayardild} (\citealt[214]{Evans:1995uf}). Nima falls in the latter category. It is a \isi{nominal} which can be marked for a subset of cases (\isi{instrumental}, \isi{characteristic}, \isi{purposive}, \isi{proprietive}, and \isi{privative}). It shares no morpho-syntactic characteristics with verbs, but may either modify a verb (\ref{ex099}) or express a whole event (\ref{ex100}). Example (\ref{ex099}) is from a pig hunting story and the morpheme ___ is accompanied by the appropriate gesture describing how and where the person was standing. In (\ref{ex100}) it expresses the whole following clause (`that I was walking towards them').

The English translation of this sentence is:`They were her children. She took care of them.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Morpho-syntactically, we can define verbs as those lexemes which inflect for \isi{gender}, \isi{person}, \isi{number}, \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect}, \isi{mood}, \isi{valency}, and \isi{directionality}, as can be seen in examples (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}). With the exception of \isi{person} and \isi{number}, these are only found in verbs. The glossing of these grammatical categories, however, cannot be done straightforwardly, because a number of them can only be understood after unifying values from different morphological slots. For example, the aspectual value \Pst:\Dur{} in (\ref{ex006}) is encoded simultaneously in the verb stem, the prefix and the durative suffix. Prior to this unification, each morpheme taken by itself is underspecified with respect to any particular grammatical category. The only exceptions are the two \isi{directional} affixes. In this subsection, I will employ a double glossing style as in the chapters on verb morphology (chapters \ref{cha:verb morphology} and \ref{TAMpalooza}). A segmented, itemised glossing line is given first, while a second line shows the unified \isi{gloss} in smaller print. Morphological complexity in verbs is discussed in {\S}\ref{verbprelim}, where the reader also finds a more detailed justification for the double-lined glossing convention.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They were her children. She took care of them.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}) show the intricate architecture of Komnzo verbs. The verb forms in both examples are inflected for various grammatical categories. The agreement target for \isi{gender} is the third \isi{person} singular prefix on the verb, as can be seen in the last verb `eat' in example (\ref{ex007}). Person and \isi{number} are encoded in the \isi{undergoer} prefix as well as the actor suffix. However, these slots are underspecified: the second and third \isi{person} in the \isi{non-singular} are neutralised in both slots. The first \isi{non-singular} and second \isi{singular} are neutralised in the prefixes. These can be disambiguated by the free pronouns. In both slots, \isi{dual} and \isi{plural} are neutralised. The system of \isi{number} marking combines a \isi{singular} vs. \isi{non-singular} opposition in the prefix and suffix with a \isi{dual} vs. \isi{non-dual} opposition in the duality affix. Thereby, one arrives at the three \isi{number} values (\Sg, \Du, \Pl). For about half a dozen high frequency verbs, such as the \isi{copula} (\ref{ex006}), the stem itself is sensitive to duality. For all other verbs, duality is either encoded by a prefix, as in the second verb `look around' in (\ref{ex007}) or by a suffix as in all other verbs in (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}). The morphological site of duality marking depends on the stem type. Almost all verbs in Komnzo have two stems from which aspectual distinctions can be build. I label the two stem types `restricted' ({\Rs}) and `extended stem' (\Ext). It follows that \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} are expressed by a combination of verb stem, prefixes, and further suffixal material. As for the prefixes, there are five different \isi{prefix series} labelled \Alph{}, \Bet{}, \Betaone{}, \Betatwo{}, and \Gam{} and an \isi{immediate past} \isi{proclitic} (for example in the last two verbs of \ref{ex007}). Beyond TAM, the prefixes encode information about \isi{person}, \isi{number}, and \isi{gender}. Examples for the suffixal material are the durative suffix (\Dur{}) in both verb forms in (\ref{ex006}) and the \isi{past} suffix (\Pst{}) in the first two verb forms in (\ref{ex007}). The TAM value is calculated by unifying these different exponents. As the final category to mention here, the first verb `arrive' in (\ref{ex007}) is inflected for \isi{directionality}. The two values of \isi{direction} are \isi{venitive} `towards' (\Venit) and \isi{andative} `away' (\Andat).

The system of \isi{number} marking combines a \isi{singular} vs. \isi{non-singular} opposition in the prefix and suffix with a \isi{dual} vs. \isi{non-dual} opposition in the duality affix. Thereby, one arrives at the three \isi{number} values (\Sg, \Du, \Pl). For about half a dozen high frequency verbs, such as the \isi{copula} (\ref{ex006}), the stem itself is sensitive to duality. For all other verbs, duality is either encoded by a prefix, as in the second verb `look around' in (\ref{ex007}) or by a suffix as in all other verbs in (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}). The morphological site of duality marking depends on the stem type. Almost all verbs in Komnzo have two stems from which aspectual distinctions can be build. I label the two stem types `restricted' ({\Rs}) and `extended stem' (\Ext). It follows that \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} are expressed by a combination of verb stem, prefixes, and further suffixal material. As for the prefixes, there are five different \isi{prefix series} labelled \Alph{}, \Bet{}, \Betaone{}, \Betatwo{}, and \Gam{} and an \isi{immediate past} \isi{proclitic} (for example in the last two verbs of \ref{ex007}). Beyond TAM, the prefixes encode information about \isi{person}, \isi{number}, and \isi{gender}. Examples for the suffixal material are the durative suffix (\Dur{}) in both verb forms in (\ref{ex006}) and the \isi{past} suffix (\Pst{}) in the first two verb forms in (\ref{ex007}). The TAM value is calculated by unifying these different exponents. As the final category to mention here, the first verb `arrive' in (\ref{ex007}) is inflected for \isi{directionality}. The two values of \isi{direction} are \isi{venitive} `towards' (\Venit) and \isi{andative} `away' (\Andat).

The system of \isi{number} marking combines a \isi{singular} vs. \isi{non-singular} opposition in the prefix and suffix with a \isi{dual} vs. \isi{non-dual} opposition in the duality affix. Thereby, one arrives at the three \isi{number} values (\Sg, \Du, \Pl). For about half a dozen high frequency verbs, such as the \isi{copula} (\ref{ex006}), the stem itself is sensitive to duality. For all other verbs, duality is either encoded by a prefix, as in the second verb `look around' in (\ref{ex007}) or by a suffix as in all other verbs in (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}). The morphological site of duality marking depends on the stem type. Almost all verbs in Komnzo have two stems from which aspectual distinctions can be build. I label the two stem types `restricted' ({\Rs}) and `extended stem' (\Ext). It follows that \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} are expressed by a combination of verb stem, prefixes, and further suffixal material. As for the prefixes, there are five different \isi{prefix series} labelled \Alph{}, \Bet{}, \Betaone{}, \Betatwo{}, and \Gam{} and an \isi{immediate past} \isi{proclitic} (for example in the last two verbs of \ref{ex007}). Beyond TAM, the prefixes encode information about \isi{person}, \isi{number}, and \isi{gender}. Examples for the suffixal material are the durative suffix (\Dur{}) in both verb forms in (\ref{ex006}) and the \isi{past} suffix (\Pst{}) in the first two verb forms in (\ref{ex007}). The TAM value is calculated by unifying these different exponents. As the final category to mention here, the first verb `arrive' in (\ref{ex007}) is inflected for \isi{directionality}. The two values of \isi{direction} are \isi{venitive} `towards' (\Venit) and \isi{andative} `away' (\Andat).

The system of \isi{number} marking combines a \isi{singular} vs. \isi{non-singular} opposition in the prefix and suffix with a \isi{dual} vs. \isi{non-dual} opposition in the duality affix. Thereby, one arrives at the three \isi{number} values (\Sg, \Du, \Pl). For about half a dozen high frequency verbs, such as the \isi{copula} (\ref{ex006}), the stem itself is sensitive to duality. For all other verbs, duality is either encoded by a prefix, as in the second verb `look around' in (\ref{ex007}) or by a suffix as in all other verbs in (\ref{ex006}) and (\ref{ex007}). The morphological site of duality marking depends on the stem type. Almost all verbs in Komnzo have two stems from which aspectual distinctions can be build. I label the two stem types `restricted' ({\Rs}) and `extended stem' (\Ext). It follows that \isi{tense}, \isi{aspect} and \isi{mood} are expressed by a combination of verb stem, prefixes, and further suffixal material. As for the prefixes, there are five different \isi{prefix series} labelled \Alph{}, \Bet{}, \Betaone{}, \Betatwo{}, and \Gam{} and an \isi{immediate past} \isi{proclitic} (for example in the last two verbs of \ref{ex007}). Beyond TAM, the prefixes encode information about \isi{person}, \isi{number}, and \isi{gender}. Examples for the suffixal material are the durative suffix (\Dur{}) in both verb forms in (\ref{ex006}) and the \isi{past} suffix (\Pst{}) in the first two verb forms in (\ref{ex007}). The TAM value is calculated by unifying these different exponents. As the final category to mention here, the first verb `arrive' in (\ref{ex007}) is inflected for \isi{directionality}. The two values of \isi{direction} are \isi{venitive} `towards' (\Venit) and \isi{andative} `away' (\Andat).

The English translation of this sentence is:`He slept over there ... like this in the dry season ... like this in the planting season.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Verbs are the only lexical items which can take the nominalising suffix (-si). Nominalisations or infinitives are used as a citation form in the dictionary. Frequently, nominalisations were frequently given to me as zokwasi ebar `head words' for an inflected verb form. Nominalisations are non-finite forms without inflectional material. Nominalisations can be treated like underived nouns. They can function as complements of phasal verbs (finish, start, become) (\ref{ex008}) or infinitival adjuncts (\ref{ex009}). Example (\ref{ex008}) is taken from a story in which two birds have a competition on how long each one can hold its breath under water. Thus, fsisi zäbthath can be translated as `the counting finished'. Example (\ref{ex009}) can be translated as `in the planting (season)'.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Verbs are the only lexical items which can take the nominalising suffix (-si). Nominalisations or infinitives are used as a citation form in the dictionary. Frequently, nominalisations were frequently given to me as zokwasi ebar `head words' for an inflected verb form. Nominalisations are non-finite forms without inflectional material. Nominalisations can be treated like underived nouns. They can function as complements of phasal verbs (finish, start, become) (\ref{ex008}) or infinitival adjuncts (\ref{ex009}). Example (\ref{ex008}) is taken from a story in which two birds have a competition on how long each one can hold its breath under water. Thus, fsisi zäbthath can be translated as `the counting finished'. Example (\ref{ex009}) can be translated as `in the planting (season)'.

Sentence (with missing item): yaka ___ sre\stem{wakuth}.
Gloss (with missing item): yamstick ___ STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:IRR:PFV/pick.up.
The English translation of this sentence is:`She picked up the yamstick to kill him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The other \isi{nominal} enclitics are no \isi{case} markers: \isi{exclusive} =nzo (\Only), empathic =wä (\Emph) and et cetera =sü (\Etc). The first forms the \isi{nominal} counterpart of the \isi{particle} komnzo ({\S}\ref{discourse-particles}). This \isi{clitic} satisfies criteria (iv) in that it is a reduced form of an independent lexical item. It functions as a contrastive \isi{focus} marker and I translate it to with \ili{English} `only'. Hence, in example (\ref{ex115}), the woman picks up the yamstick with only one thing on her mind. Note that this example shows that the \isi{clitic} =nzo satisfies criteria (iii): the ability to attach to other clitics. The \isi{exclusive} \isi{enclitic} =nzo will be discussed again {\S}\ref{exclusivenzo}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`You must not think bad about how we made up our minds.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The second set of verbal proclitics comprises m= and n=. Depending on their morpho-syntactic context, they can be classified as either clitics or particles. The m= \isi{proclitic} was briefly addressed in {\S}\ref{demonstrative-identifiers-subsec}. We saw in \tabref{demonstratives-table}, that m= patterns with the interrogatives. Thus, it patterns with the three \isi{deictic} proclitics. However, this is a marginal function, because it is found only with the copula. More frequently, m= occurs with verb forms in \isi{irrealis} or \isi{imperative} mood. In this case it adds the meaning of apprehension (`X might happen!'), as in (\ref{ex119}). Furthermore, with \isi{imperative} verb forms only \uline{and} with the \isi{potential} \isi{particle} kma it expresses prohibition (`don't do X!'), as in (\ref{ex111}). In this latter function, m is analysed as a \isi{particle} rather than a \isi{proclitic}. This is discussed in detail in {\S}\ref{apprehensivem}.
A: word: kma=m	 gloss: Pot=Appr

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The three adverbial demonstratives in the \isi{allative} \isi{case} may also be used to express meaning `its gloss ___' both in a spatial and \isi{temporal} sense. However, they have to marked for the \isi{purposive} \isi{case}, thus producing the forms zbomr from zbo, the morpheme ___ from bobo, and fobomr from fbo. This is not possible with the corresponding ablative forms, i.e. zbamr, bobamr and fobamr are all ungrammatical. Example (\ref{ex126}) shows one occurrence of the morpheme ___ with a \isi{temporal} meaning of `its gloss ___'. Here, the speaker describes her daily routine in the high school in Daru.
A: word: bobomr	 gloss: until
