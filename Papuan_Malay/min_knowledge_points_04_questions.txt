Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Reduplication of content words is demonstrated with the three examples in (\ref{Example_4.3}) to (\ref{Example_4.5}). Reduplication of a \isi{noun} is illustrated in (\ref{Example_4.3}); in this context reduplicated \textitbf{ade} ‘younger sibling’ conveys plurality. The utterance in (\ref{Example_4.4}) includes a reduplicated \isi{verb}; in this context, \textitbf{lari} ‘run’ expresses \isi{continuation}. And the elicited example in (\ref{Example_4.5}) illustrates \isi{reduplication} of an ad\isi{verb}; in this context \isi{prohibitive} \textitbf{jangang} ‘\textsc{neg.imp}, don’t’ denotes \isi{intensity}. The three examples illustrate only three of the different meanings expressed with \isi{reduplication}. Depending on the context, a reduplicated \isi{noun} can also signal \isi{repetition}, to name just one other meaning aspect. Along similar lines, a reduplicated \isi{verb} can also express \isi{aimlessness}, among other meanings. This variety of different meanings is discussed in detail in §\ref{Para_4.2}.
