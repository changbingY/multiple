Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Papuan Malay employs imperatives and hortatives to issues commands. Imperatives always involve the second person, given that the addressee is the one who is expected to carry out the requested action, as shown in (\ref{Example_13.42}) to (\ref{Example_13.46}). In hortatives, by contrast, any person other than the addressee is expected to carry out the requested action. Hence, hortatives involve first and third persons, as shown in (\ref{Example_13.47}) to (\ref{Example_13.51}). In addition, Papuan Malay also employs a number of strategies to strengthen or soften commands, as demonstrated in (\ref{Example_13.52}) to (\ref{Example_13.61}).
