The English translation of this sentence is:‘The voice of the seal cried: I am king Tangaroa.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As both noun phrases are referential\is{Referentiality} and definite\is{Definiteness}, and both refer to the same entity, it is not always clear which NP is subject and which is predicate. Constituent order\is{Constituent order} cannot be used as the sole criterion, as both subject and predicate of a nominal clause\is{Clause!nominal} may come first.\footnote{\label{fn:461}See examples (\ref{ex:9.1}–\ref{ex:9.6}) in classifying clauses\is{Clause!classifying}; the same is true in other types of nominal clauses\is{Clause!nominal}, e.g. locative clauses (\sectref{sec:9.4.1}).} It is even questionable whether the term predicate is appropriate at all in identifying clauses\is{Clause!identifying} (see \citealt[440]{Anderson2004}): as both noun phrases are referential expressions, they are fundamentally different from predicates, which designate properties or events rather than referring to entities.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: To give an example, in the context preceding \REF{ex:9.20} above, there has been no mention of the son of the sun and the high God, so the hearer does not necessarily know that there is such a person as the child of the sun, or that the people in the story had a high God at all. Therefore, this person is not accessible to the hearer. By contrast, in \REF{ex:9.23}, ‘those witches’ refers to witches who have been mentioned earlier in the story; the identifying clause enables the hearer to identify this known entity with the subject ‘those people’. Similarly, in \REF{ex:9.24} the speaker refers to a type of fishing line which he assumes to be known by the hearer (even though it has not been mentioned in the text itself).

A compelling reason to adopt this analysis of \REF{ex:9.97} is, that the subject of a verb marked with mo is normally expressed as a possessive (\sectref{sec:11.5.1.2}). The fact that the subject in \REF{ex:9.97} is nominative koe, makes it an unlikely candidate for the subject position of the mo-clause.
