Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \textsc{Complementizers} are words that introduce \isi{reported speech} or thought. For example, in the English sentence ‘She said that she agrees’, the word that is the \isi{complementizer} that introduces that reported statement she agrees. Ik has only two complementizers. One of them, \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-} ‘that’, is technically a noun and thus belongs in the noun word class. But because of its function, it is dealt with here. The word \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-}, a compound of the verb tód- ‘speak’ and mɛná- ‘words’, is used with a variety of speaking and thinking verbs. The second Ik \isi{complementizer}, tàà, is a probably a derivative of the verb kʉta ‘(s)he says’ that has been reduced over time. Even now it is usually used after the verb \textit{k\`{ʉ}t-} ‘say’. Example \REF{ex:morph:9} shows how \textit{tòìm\`{ɛ}nà-} is used in a sentence to introduce the clause \textit{mɨt{\Í}da bɔnán} ‘you are an orphan’. And example \REF{ex:morph:10} shows the \isi{complementizer} tàà introducing the clause \textit{iya ɲjíníkiʝa k\'{ɔ}\'{ɔ}kɛ} ‘our land is over there’:
A: word: toimɛna	 gloss: that:NOM
