Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given that Pichi does not mark number on nouns morphologically, the morpheme ___, rather than sɔn, is used to express that singular number is a significant feature of the referent as in the morpheme ___ motó ‘its gloss ___ car’ \REF{ex:key:177}\is{cardinal numerals}.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘It is then that these ones’ mothers do every thing.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I repeat sentence \REF{ex:key:195} in \REF{ex:key:220} below. As is generally the case in dislocated possessive constructions, a personal pronoun coreferential with the possessor (dɛn ‘\textsc{3pl}’) links the plural possessor (the morpheme ___ wán dɛn ‘these ones’) and the possessed noun (mamá ‘mother’). I interpret the linker dɛn in these cases as the \textsc{3pl} pronoun rather than the pluraliser, since singular possessors require the use of the corresponding singular possessive pronoun in ‘\textsc{3sg.poss}’ in the same position. Hence the pluraliser remains unexpressed in the construction in order to avoid doubling of the two homophonous forms:
A: word: dís	 gloss: this

Here, the morpheme ___ may be interpreted as the pluraliser postposed to the NP or instead, as a resumptive pronoun\is{resumptive pronouns} and the subject of the following verb. In contexts such as these, where a predicate immediately follows a plural-referring \textsc{NP}, the distinction between the pluraliser and a \textsc{3pl} resumptive pronoun is not possible, since doubling of the form is normally avoided. The distributional characteristics of the morpheme ___ in these contexts indicate the significant functional overlap of \textsc{NP} and verbal number marking in Pichi:

The numeral wán also expresses adverbial meanings such as ‘alone, single-handedly’ with an emphatic{\fff} nuance, as in \REF{ex:key:257}. When used in its gloss ___ way, wán may modify a head noun post-nominally like a postnominal modifier, such as the focus particle sɛ́f ‘self, emp’. However, wán does not modify full nouns by itself.
