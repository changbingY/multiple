You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ patú ǰumeet-í the ba-yáan-u

The English translation of this sentence is:`When I have taken it [a bath], I go to the mosque.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Perfective Participle clauses with a~postposition, such as pahúrta, baád, patú, all glossed as `after', are also used in temporal subsequence (construction~(iv)), thereby giving them an explicit ``temporal anteriority'' reading \citep[159]{cristofaro2005}. pahúrta (in (\ref{ex:13-59})) and baád (in (\ref{ex:13-60})) each govern the genitive case of the participle, whereas patú (in (\ref{ex:13-61})) takes the nominative.

Question 429:
You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): áa deés se phoó xiaál thíil-i híni ki tuúš čhoót míi se yaar-íi rumeel-í maǰí ɡhaṇḍ-í ___ keé-na ɡal-úum

The English translation of this sentence is:`One day the boy thought, ``Why don't I put some cheese in my friend's handkerchief and throw it into the water?'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Related utterances in Palula always occur as direct quotations, as can be seen in the examples (\ref{ex:13-127})--(\ref{ex:13-131}), or more correctly, they are always presented from a~quoted"=speaker's or experiencer's (i.e., the subject of the matrix clause) perspective, as far as deixis, pronominal and time reference is concerned. Non"=oral perception or cognition\footnote{It is probably equally possible to classify the predicate in a~sentence like this as desiderative~-- i.e., expressing a~desire that the proposition be realised~-- rather than as an~uttererance predicate.} is treated in this way too, i.e., thoughts, as in (\ref{ex:13-132}), are presented from the thinking agent's perspective, as if they were uttered orally (a marginal exception to this is found with what I refer to below as ``immediate perception predicates'').

Again, the distinction between these and utterance predicates is not always very obvious, as the complement often occurs as reported discourse, and there is probably quite some overlap. Typically, the complement clause is formed as a~question, with keé `why' in (\ref{ex:13-140}) or kateeṇí `what kind' in (\ref{ex:13-141}).
