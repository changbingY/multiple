Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ a nang gibii.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1S.ABS only/just yesterday
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I just let it rain (on me) yesterday.’ (Instead of going inside he kept trying to spear a wild pig.)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref149030144} illustrates a kind of reflexive construction. This is not an experiential construction (i.e., there is no applicative marker indicating the absolutive is the experiencer of the situation), but the implication is that the speaker “let it rain” on himself while hunting (see \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:causatives} for this reflexive use of the detransitive causative ga-pa- or mag-pa-):
A: word: ga-pa-uran	 gloss: I.R-CAUS-rain
B: word: pa-pa-uran-an	 gloss: T.R-CAUS-rain-APL
C: word: ga-uran	 gloss: I.R-rain
D: word: salíg	 gloss: think.wrongly

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG 1S.ABS DEF.N LK I.V.IR-go.with 1S.ABS A.HAP.IR-PL-visit
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he told me that I will go with (him) to go visiting.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Occasionally, the recipient may be expressed as the absolutive with no applicative marking. In that case, the implication is the speech is more direct or frank. For example, \REF{bkm:Ref402322426} is about a fairy telling a person to go with him to the world of the dead. This is an unusual and momentous direct request, and so the applicative is not used. This emphasizes the usually direct nature of this statement. Example \REF{bkm:Ref122516350} is about a woman telling her mother to regret or repent of her sins, which also is an unusually frank thing for anyone to say to their parents.
A: word: pa-ambaļ	 gloss: T.R-say

The English translation of this sentence is:‘We (the women) met together again with our male companions. As for them, their house was different (from ours).’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The root kita with the meaning of ‘see’ only occurs in happenstantial modality. The causative stem, pakita, may occur in dynamic modality with the meaning of ‘to show’. The reciprocal stem, kitaay ‘to meet together’, may also appear in dynamic modality. There are thirty-eight examples of stems based on kita functioning as predicates in dynamic modality in the corpus, twelve of which are causatives and twenty-six of which are reciprocals. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref121468636} and \REF{bkm:Ref121468640} illustrate the reciprocal usage:
A: word: ga-kita-ay	 gloss: I.R-see-REC

The English translation of this sentence is:`Not long afterwards, we heard the drone of the airplane.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The root mati ‘to hear/listen’ is of Class V, subclass Vb of non-volitional semantically transitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} roots, and Class VIII, volitional transitive roots, depending on the context. Both of these classes are those that take the applicative -an in their basic transitive form (see \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}, \sectref{sec:overviewofeightverbclasses}). In happenstantial modality with the applicative, the meaning tends to be unintentional: ‘to hear’ (\ref{bkm:Ref121468755} and \ref{bkm:Ref121468759}), and in dynamic modalities the meaning is more intentional: ‘to listen’ (\ref{bkm:Ref121468840} and \ref{bkm:Ref121468843}):
A: word: na-mati-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-hear-APL

The English translation of this sentence is:‘When you listen to someone weaving a mat, it is the same as one person typing.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The root mati ‘to hear/listen’ is of Class V, subclass Vb of non-volitional semantically transitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} roots, and Class VIII, volitional transitive roots, depending on the context. Both of these classes are those that take the applicative -an in their basic transitive form (see \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}, \sectref{sec:overviewofeightverbclasses}). In happenstantial modality with the applicative, the meaning tends to be unintentional: ‘to hear’ (\ref{bkm:Ref121468755} and \ref{bkm:Ref121468759}), and in dynamic modalities the meaning is more intentional: ‘to listen’ (\ref{bkm:Ref121468840} and \ref{bkm:Ref121468843}):

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1S.ABS 3S.ERG if/when I.V.IR-go/walk 1S.ABS
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he took notice of me whenever I leave.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the verb batyag is used in a transitive frame, the experiencer is in the ergative case and the stimulus, the item or sensation felt, is absolutive as in \REF{ex:becomingverybig} through \REF{bkm:Ref123389246}, and \REF{bkm:Ref122549938}. In an intransitive frame, the experiencer is absolutive and the stimulus, if present, is oblique (several examples from \ref{ex:willrun} through \ref{ex:asthmaattack}). Of the sixty examples of batyag used as a inflected predicate in the corpus, thirty-eight are in happenstantial modality plus the applicative \nobreakdash-an or its exclamatory equivalent -i (two examples). Twenty are expressed in dynamic modality (usages 6 and 7). There are no examples of batyag with the non-applicative exclamatory suffix -a.

The English translation of this sentence is:`When I was on the beach of Peek I felt hunger and exhaustion of my body.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{ex:becomingverybig} and \REF{bkm:Ref122532854} illustrate the difference in meaning between the first two usages of batyag. Both are from the same first person personal experience recounted by a fisherman whose boat overturned in rough seas. While fishing he noticed that he felt hungry, and uses nabatyag \REF{ex:becomingverybig} (usage 2). Then, after surviving the accident and coming ashore, he was feeling intense hunger and tiredness and used nabatyagan, shown in example \REF{bkm:Ref122532854} (usage 1):

Sentence (with missing item): Man-o tak ___ ka?
Gloss (with missing item): why because ___ 2S.ABS
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Why are you sorrowing?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref123572729} illustrates that the pluraction prefix ng{}- is not strictly “agreement” with a plural experiencer, since the experiencer in this example is singular. Although pluraction for stems expressing sadness and joy overwhelmingly occur with plural experiencers, this is not a grammatical restriction. The sense in example \REF{bkm:Ref123572729} is that the actor is sorrowing over and over again, over a long period of time.
A: word: ga-ng-ka-sebe	 gloss: I.R-PL-VBLZ-sad

The English translation of this sentence is:`S/he was concerned for/took care of us when we slept there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The following are examples of intindi ‘to understand’ (from Spanish entender ‘to understand’) from the corpus. The only example in the corpus of the detransitive dynamic form of intindi is a reciprocal (\ref{bkm:Ref123631997}). However, other examples do occur in conversation (\ref{bkm:Ref123632049}). The reciprocal can mean either to understand each other or to get along together well:
A: word: ga-intindi	 gloss: I.R-understand
B: word: naka-intindi	 gloss: I.HAP.R-understand
C: word: ino-en	 gloss: what-T.IR

Sentence (with missing item): ___ din daw ga-laeg-laeg a nang.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG if/when I.R-RED-joke 1S.ABS only/just
The English translation of this sentence is:‘She thought wrongly that I was just joking.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The word salig ‘to think wrongly’ usually occurs as a bare root, and so may be thought of either as a “defective” verb, or something falling in between the verb and adverb categories. This is in contrast to the verbal root sálig ‘to trust’ (prominence on first syllable). In example \REF{bkm:Ref123650588} it is clear that salig 'to think wrongly' is functioning as a transitive predicate with an ergative Cognizer and a complement clause as the absolutive stimulus, though it carries no inflection.
A: word: salíg	 gloss: think.wrongly
B: word: salamat	 gloss: thank
C: word: ga-negga	 gloss: I.R-lie
