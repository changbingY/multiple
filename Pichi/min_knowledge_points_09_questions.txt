Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The bulk of Pichi verbs can occur with one as well as two objects\is{objects}. The primacy of the object next to the verb – which is usually animate and has the role of recipient\is{recipient} or beneficiary – is evident in double-object constructions involving two object pronouns. The presence of two pronominal objects is ungrammatical if the clitic object pronoun =an is preceded by the low-toned personal pronoun una/the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{2pl}’ or another \textsc{3sg.obj} pronoun =an (for details, see \sectref{sec:3.3}, on tone-conditioned suppletive allomorphy). In such cases, it is the patient object that remains unexpressed. Compare the double-object construction in \REF{ex:key:1199} with the ungrammatical example \REF{ex:key:1200} and sentence \REF{ex:key:1201}. In the latter example, the \textsc{3sg.obj} theme\is{theme} object =an remains unexpressed:

The two participants may be expressed as coordinate subject{\fff}s in an intransitive clause while reciprocity is understood. Compare the transitive use of the morpheme ___t ‘meet’ in \REF{ex:key:1315}, with its intransitive use with two coordinate subjects in \REF{ex:key:1316}:
A: word: mí	 gloss: 1SG.INDP

The English translation of this sentence is:‘The lottery has made my money become a lot.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Two types of causative constructions can be distinguished on formal grounds (cf. \citealt{Yakpo2012a}, \citealt{Yakpo2017a}). The most common type of causative construction in Pichi inolves a “balanced” structure \citep{Cristofaro2003}. The causative event is expressed in two finite clauses and the causative verb and the verb-of-effect are linked in a relation of subordination\is{subordination}. Sentence \REF{ex:key:1321} below features the (inanimate) causer NP lotería ‘lottery’, the causative main verb the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’, the causee NP mi mɔní ‘my money’, and the subordinate verb-of-effect bɔkú ‘be much’. The subordinate status of the effect situation is evident through its appearance in a subjunctive clause introduced by the modal complementiser and subjunctive marker the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{sbjv}’:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘I’ll make him go tomorrow.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The second type of causative construction involves a “deranked” \citep{Cristofaro2003} or “reduced” \citep{Lehmann1988} structure and argument sharing. The causee (here =an \textsc{‘3sg.obj’}) is the syntactic object of the causative main verb mék and at once the notional subject of the subordinate verb-of-effect gó as in \REF{ex:key:1322}. This construction is marginal in terms of frequency, and only attested with Group 1 speakers (cf. \sectref{sec:1.3}). I could not identify any semantic differences between the two types of caustive constructions:
