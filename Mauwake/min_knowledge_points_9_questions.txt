The English translation of this sentence is:`And my younger sibling was killed by a bullet (lit: arrow).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The contrastive focus marker is also used for subject disambiguation. When an object of a clause is fronted as the theme, the constituent order changes from \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{sov}} to \textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textsc{osv}}. If both the subject and object are in the third person and are realized as overt \textsc{np}s, this creates a potential ambiguity as to which one is which argument. The contrastive focus marker, added to the subject, may first have been used to disambiguate clauses like \REF{ex:9:x1695} and later spread as an optional marking even to clauses where the verbal suffix distinguishes the two arguments and which would not need this extra marking \REF{ex:9:x1696}. Without the contrastive focus marking, the example \REF{ex:9:x1695} would mean `and my younger sibling got/took an arrow/a bullet'.
