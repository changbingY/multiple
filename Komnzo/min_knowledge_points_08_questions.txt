Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): nzürna ŋare=f ___ sa\stem{sryofth}a züm.
Gloss (with missing item): nzürna woman=ERG.SG ___ SG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:IO:PST:PFV/send centipede.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The nzürna woman sent those ones after him ... the centipedes.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The dominant word order in Komnzo is AUV (actor \isi{undergoer} verb). Recipients of ditransitives also precede the verb and follow the actor noun phrase, but there is no clear position with respect to the \isi{theme} argument. Evidence for basic word order comes from the use of the \isi{recognitional} \isi{demonstrative} ({\S}\ref{recognitional-pronoun-subsec}). In example (\ref{ex686}), the \isi{object} argument is expressed first by the \isi{recognitional} the morpheme ___ `those' and then by the noun züm `centipedes'. The speaker uses the \isi{recognitional} in the absolutive case in the position where the constituent normally occurs. This is a tip-of-the-tongue situation, and therefore the speaker fills in the appropriate referent after the verb. Note that there is usually a break in the intonation contour if any constituent occurs after the verb.

Sentence (with missing item): nzone ngom fof ... ___ emoth naf ze\stem{faf}a fof.
Gloss (with missing item): FSG.POSS brother.in.law EMPH ... ___ girl TSG.ERG SG:SBJ:PST:PFV/marry EMPH.
The English translation of this sentence is:`My brother-in-law ... He married a Mayawa sister.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: AUV word order is only a tendency in Komnzo. In fact, most clauses lack overt \isi{noun phrase}s for the respective constituents. The flagging of \isi{noun phrase}s with \isi{case} allows for some flexibility in the arrangement of constituents. However, deviations from the basic word order are often pragmatically motivated. In example (\ref{ex716}),\footnote{Note that the stem fath- means `hold', but in a suppressed-object construction it means `marry' ({\S}\ref{suppressedobjectclause}).} the speaker replies to a question whether a particular individual is his brother-in-law. He says `really my brother-in-law' and then gives an explanation in the following clause, where the \isi{undergoer} appears before the actor. The reversal of constituents can be explained as a strategy to focus the \isi{undergoer} argument, that is the morpheme ___ emoth `Mayawa sister' is focussed by fronting.
A: word: mayawa	 gloss: mayawa
B: word: mayawa=medbo	 gloss: mayawa=All.ANIM.NSG
C: word: mayawa=ma	 gloss: mayawa=CHAR
D: word: borsi	 gloss: laugh-NMLZ

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): kata-katan kwa zöbthé thrän\stem{gathinz}th nima ___ komnzo kwa.
Gloss (with missing item): REDUP-small FUT first STPL:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:IRR:PFV:VENIT/stop Quot ___ only wait.
The English translation of this sentence is:`First, they will hold back the small ones and say: ``Wait! Just Wait!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The TAM particles the morpheme ___ {\Fut} and kma {\Pot} can stand alone when they are used as commands. For example, kma can mean `You have to!', and with the \isi{apprehensive} clitic =m attached, it can mean the opposite: kmam `You must not!'. In example (\ref{ex560}), the \isi{future} particle the morpheme ___ is used in the sense of `Wait!'. The speaker describes poison-root fishing and how they have to hold back the children from jumping into the water too early.
A: word: kwa	 gloss: wait
B: word: zokwasi=me=wä	 gloss: speech=INS=EMPH
C: word: zfth=nzo	 gloss: base=ONLY
D: word: nzä	 gloss: FSG.ABS

Sentence (with missing item): fi kafar mane e\stem{rä}ra näbi ane ofe ŋa\stem{rä}rath. mobo e\stem{rä}ra ... ___ miyamr.
Gloss (with missing item): but big which STPL:SBJ:PST:IPFV/be one DEM disappearance STPL:SBJ:PST:IPFV/do where.All ... STPL:SBJ:PST:IPFV/be ___ ignorance.
The English translation of this sentence is:`As for the big dogs, they disappeared for good. Where did they go? ... I (do) not know.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another possible type of verbless \isi{clause} is with the property nouns miyo `desire' and miyatha `knowledge' and their antonyms miyomär `aversion, dislike' and miyamr `ignorance'. These words are usually used as \isi{nominal} predicates with light verbs or with the \isi{copula}. As a consequence, we find examples like ({\ref{ex561}}), where the last \isi{clause} the morpheme ___ miyamr does not contain a verb. It is possible to insert the \isi{copula} in the appropriate inflection (worera \Fsg:\Sbj:\Pst:\Ipfv/be), but often it is left out. Apart from examples like these, there are no verbless clauses in Komnzo.
A: word: nzä	 gloss: FSG.ABS
B: word: nzä=nzo	 gloss: FSG.ABS=ONLY
C: word: zawe	 gloss: preference
D: word: etfth	 gloss: sleep

The English translation of this sentence is:`We are not many ... because this was going on in our \isi{middle} ... The people, this (group) and that (group) were killing each other.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In most cases only secondary information disambiguates between \isi{intransitive}, \isi{impersonal} and \isi{reflexive}/\isi{reciprocal} interpretations. By secondary information, I mean (i) context, (ii) grammatical devices which are not used solely for \isi{reflexive}/\isi{reciprocal} constructions, (iii) statistical tendencies of individual verbs. I will address these in turn. First, context is probably the most important, and it is evident that an example like (\ref{ex566}) is usually preceded or followed by a description which disambiguates the state of affairs. Secondly, speakers may choose to repeat the absolutive noun phrase to make clear that the intended reading should be a \isi{reciprocal} one. Consider example (\ref{ex567}), which concludes a headhunting story. The \isi{pronoun} fi occurs twice. Additionally, the utterance was accompanied by appropriate gestures to clarify the intended \isi{reciprocal} meaning. The \isi{pronoun} fi is marked with the \isi{exclusive} \isi{enclitic} =nzo. The repetition and the \isi{exclusive} \isi{enclitic} are secondary strategies which are not solely used to mark \isi{reflexive}/\isi{reciprocal} meanings. Note that the \isi{exclusive} \isi{enclitic} =nzo shows cognates in other \ili{Yam languages}. In \ili{Nen}, there is a set of \isi{reflexive}/\isi{reciprocal} pronouns which all end in nzo, for example benzo \Ssg{} (\citealt[1072]{Evans:2015wy}). In Komnzo, the \isi{exclusive} clitic expresses the meaning of `only' without \isi{reflexive}/\isi{reciprocal} semantics.
A: word: fi=nzo	 gloss: Third.ABS=ONLY
B: word: bäi=nzo	 gloss: bäi=ONLY
C: word: fi=wä	 gloss: Third.ABS=EMPH

The English translation of this sentence is:`What (of hers) might be lying there? ... her sweet potatoes?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As I pointed out in {\S}\ref{prefixingverbsec}, prefixing verbs (intransitives) can enter the same pattern, in which a \isi{beneficiary} or raised \isi{possessor}, in \isi{dative} and \isi{possessive} case respectively, is indexed in the verb form. Example (\ref{ex741}) is taken from a recording where two speakers discuss the content of a picture card. The prefixing verb -thn `be lying' in the example does not index the objects that are lying on the ground, but the \isi{possessor} instead.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I really had to take a dump there on top (of the tree).' (Lit: `Excretions finish me.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples like (\ref{ex578}) were given to me in elicitation, when asking `How do I say `I am hungry?'. I first encountered \isi{experiencer-object} constructions in more natural situations, for example in overhearing conversations or when translating recordings. Komnzo speakers explicitly regard \isi{experiencer-object} constructions as more original and creative language. Therefore, it seems natural that these were rarely offered in the context of elicitation. Experiencer-object constructions portray a situation in much more colourful terms. They often evoke some kind of emotional reaction (laughter or sympathy) from the audience, as in (\ref{ex685}), where a woman describes what happened to her as a small child when she was hiding in a tree from a pig.

The English translation of this sentence is:`That is when he got really angry.' (lit. `Anger finished him.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Experiencer-object constructions express bodily and mental processes, and it is this internal \isi{stimulus} which `acts' on the \isi{experiencer}. Two text examples were given in the description of the \isi{ergative} \isi{case} ({\S}\ref{ergcase}) and are repeated here as (\ref{ex580}) and (\ref{ex581}).

Question 18:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): baf fthé srä\stem{bth} nima ... ___ zan miyo=f.
Gloss (with missing item): Recog.ERG.SG when STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:IRR:PFV/finish like.this ... ___ hitting desire=ERG.
The English translation of this sentence is:`That is when this overcomes him ... the bloodlust for people.' (lit. `People killing desire finishes him.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{stimulus} noun phrase can be modified, for example with a \isi{nominal} compound. In example (\ref{ex582}) the \isi{stimulus} miyo `desire' is modified by two elements yielding the morpheme ___ zan miyo `desire to kill people'. This example is repeated from the discussion of complex heads in {\S}\ref{compounds-subsec}.
A: word: kabe	 gloss: man
B: word: kabe=é	 gloss: people=ERG.NSG

Gloss (with missing item): ___ Dim shiver ah shiver=ERG.NSG IMN STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:Rpst:PFV/pull.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The small child was almost shivering' (lit. `The shivers were about to pull him.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Experiencer-object constructions differ in their basic word order from other clauses in that the \isi{experiencer}, the \isi{object}, comes first. This can be explained by the special semantics of the \isi{experiencer-object} construction, in which the most salient element is the \isi{experiencer}. However, most of the examples in this section do not include an overt noun phrase. One example from the corpus is given in (\ref{ex583}). Note that the speaker corrects himself in this example. He first uses the \isi{absolutive} (frfr) `shiver', but then repeats the same noun in the \isi{ergative} (frfré).

The English translation of this sentence is:`The small child was almost shivering' (lit. `The shivers were about to pull him.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note that in (\ref{ex583}) and (\ref{ex580}), the noun phrase is marked with the \isi{non-singular} \isi{ergative} (=é), while the verb indexes a singular actor. All other examples in the corpus employ the \isi{singular} \isi{ergative} (=f). In fact, these are the only examples in the corpus, where an inanimate referent receives a non-singular ergative. Note that there is no number distinction for inanimate referent for all case enclitics. We can draw two conlcusions from this observation. First, experiencer object construction give the stimulus are somewhat elevated status of animacy, i.e. the stimulus is portrayed as being animate. Secondly, the fact that the verb inflection is singular, rather than plural, is evidence for the limited grammatical behaviour of property nouns. Property nouns do not trigger agreement in the verb and the only construction in which property nouns show quasi-agreement is the experiencer-object construction. I call this ``quasi-agreement'' because it is default \Stsg{} in the suffix ({\S}\ref{propertynouns-sec}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cognate objects are a common phenomenon in Komnzo. Examples (\ref{ex731}-\ref{ex730}) contain a nominalised \isi{verb} and an inflected verb. In all three examples, the \isi{nominalisation} and the inflected verb form are of the same lexeme. Hence, (\ref{ex731}) translates literally as `I tell them the telling'. The inflected verb indexes the indirect object (\Stpl) and as with other \isi{ditransitive} verbs, trikasi is the direct \isi{object} of the verb.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He laughs.' (lit. `He laughs the laughing.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is an analytical problem with verbs which occur in the \isi{middle} template. Example (\ref{ex730}) translates literally as `He laughs the laughter' or as `He laughter-laughs'. The \isi{middle} template used in (\ref{ex729}) and (\ref{ex730}) only indexes the \isi{subject} argument, not the \isi{object}. Because of this, it cannot be determined whether the nominalisations maikasi `washing' and the morpheme ___ `laughing' function as objects or whether they function predicatively. We will see below that a predicative function is a possible analysis in some cases. From this perspective, \isi{cognate object}s and predicative \isi{nominal}s in \isi{light verb} constructions can be portrayed as contiguous phenomena. Light verb constructions are described in the following section ({\S}\ref{lightverb}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`He was sleeping soundly.' (lit. `He was dead sleep sleeping.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A second problem is that many verbs lack regular nominalisations, which are formed with the suffix -si. These verbs use a common noun, as in example (\ref{ex564}). The adjective kwosi `dead' functions adverbially and adds the meaning of a deep its gloss ___. The noun the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___', however, is semantically fully included in the meaning of the verb rug- `its gloss ___', just as the regular \isi{nominalisation} borsi `laugh' is included in the stem of the inflected verb in (\ref{ex730}). As a consequence, the morpheme ___ is optional and the sentence would be grammatical without it. Note that the same is true of examples (\ref{ex731}-\ref{ex730}).

Question 37:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ ŋa\stem{bor}wr.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ STSG:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/laugh.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He laughs.' (lit. `He laughs the laughing.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A second problem is that many verbs lack regular nominalisations, which are formed with the suffix -si. These verbs use a common noun, as in example (\ref{ex564}). The adjective kwosi `dead' functions adverbially and adds the meaning of a deep sleep. The noun etfth `sleep', however, is semantically fully included in the meaning of the verb rug- `sleep', just as the regular \isi{nominalisation} the morpheme ___ `laugh' is included in the stem of the inflected verb in (\ref{ex730}). As a consequence, etfth is optional and the sentence would be grammatical without it. Note that the same is true of examples (\ref{ex731}-\ref{ex730}).

Question 38:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): fi ___ kwosi sf\stem{rugr}m.
Gloss (with missing item): Third.ABS ___ dead TSG.MASC:SBJ:PST:DUR/sleep.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He was sleeping soundly.' (lit. `He was dead sleep sleeping.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For want of a better term, I label examples like (\ref{ex564}) `\isi{pseudo-cognate object}' constructions. They are unlike cognate objects because the verb stem and the \isi{nominal} element are formally not related. Other examples are rnzür- `dance, sing' and wath `dance (n), song' and -nor `shout, emit sound' and kwan `shout (n)'. Although the verb stem and the noun are not cognate, distributional evidence shows that they stand in the same relationship as an inflected verb and the corresponding regular \isi{nominalisation} with -si. For example, the phasal verb bthaksi `finish' takes the noun wath `dance (n), song' to mean `finish singing'. This is because there is no regular \isi{nominalisation} available for the verb rnzür- `dance, sing'.

Question 39:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ etfth kwof\stem{rugr}m e zizi.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ sleep FSG:SBJ:PST:DUR/sleep until afternoon.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I was sleeping during the day until the afternoon.' (lit. `I was day-sleep sleeping.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The noun in these constructions is not always redundant. For example, it can be modified as the \isi{head} of a compound, thereby modifying the predicate. In (\ref{ex565}), the noun etfth `sleep' occurs in a compound modified by the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' indicating that the speaker was sleeping during the its gloss ___.

Sentence (with missing item): nze ane ___ ä\stem{trik}wé.
Gloss (with missing item): FSG.ERG DEM ___ FSG:SBJ>STPL:IO:NONPAST:IPFV/tell.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I tell them the story.' (lit. `I tell them the telling.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We have seen above that cognate and pseudo-cognate constructions are similar to \isi{light verb} constructions in that a \isi{nominal} element contributes to the meaning of the predicate. They are markedly different in the degree of modification, because light verbs are much more general in their semantics (rä- `do', fiyoksi `make', ko- `become'). It might be best to view this as a cline: at one end of the spectrum we have \isi{cognate object} constructions, where the \isi{nominalisation} of the verb occurs together with the same verb, as in examples (\ref{ex731}-\ref{ex730}). On the other end of the spectrum we have \isi{light verb} constructions, where the \isi{nominal} element not only carries most of the meaning of the predicate, but it always differs formally from the verb. Light verbs are described in the next section.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Okay, this one is sitting. He is thinking.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{light verb} `do' is usually used in the middle template indexing only the \isi{subject} argument. A very frequent collocation is with the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___', thus, literally: `do its gloss ___s' means `think'. Examples (\ref{ex590}) and (\ref{ex591}) are taken from a picture stimulus task. Note that the morpheme ___ is not indexed in the \isi{verb} form, even if the \isi{light verb} indexes an \isi{object}. In (\ref{ex591}), the morpheme ___ functions predicatively, and a literal translation of `He thinks of her' is `He its gloss ___-does her'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Okay, this one is sitting. He is thinking.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This is a general feature of light verbs. They require a \isi{nominal} element which functions predicatively. Hence, we find predicative \isi{nominal}s in both intransitive (\ref{ex590}) and \isi{transitive} structures (\ref{ex591}). In these examples, the predicative \isi{nominal} was the noun the morpheme ___, but very often property nouns are used for this function, especially property nouns with more event-oriented semantics. In example (\ref{ex592}), the speaker remarks that his dogs have disappeared. The meaning of disappearing is expressed by the \isi{property noun} ofe `absent/absence'.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb fiyoksi `make' can occur as a prototypical \isi{transitive} verb without the ``semantic assistance'' of a predicative nominal. However, it commonly occurs as a \isi{light verb}. In example (\ref{ex597}), we find two occurences of fiyoksi. The first token indexes zrin `problem, burden' (\Tsg.\F) as its object argument, and fiyoksi can be translated as `create'. The second token of fiyoksi indexes the subject. In the latter, the predicative nominal durua `help' contributes most of the semantic content of the predicate.

In the latter, the predicative nominal durua `help' contributes most of the semantic content of the predicate.

Question 56:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): nzä nima bone zrin \stem{rä} bone nagay=f ane zrin zwa\stem{fiyok}wr keke kwa mon=me ___ ŋa\stem{fiyok}wre.
Gloss (with missing item): FSG.ABS Quot SSG.POSS problem TSG.F:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be SSG.POSS child=ERG.SG DEM problem STSG:SBJ>TSG.F:OBJ:Rpst:IPFV/make NEG FUT how=INS ___ FPL:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/make.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I said: ``This is your problem. Your child has created this problem. We will not help.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb fiyoksi `make' can occur as a prototypical \isi{transitive} verb without the ``semantic assistance'' of a predicative nominal. However, it commonly occurs as a \isi{light verb}. In example (\ref{ex597}), we find two occurences of fiyoksi. The first token indexes zrin `problem, burden' (\Tsg.\F) as its object argument, and fiyoksi can be translated as `create'. The second token of fiyoksi indexes the subject. In the latter, the predicative nominal the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' contributes most of the semantic content of the predicate.
A: word: durua	 gloss: help
B: word: ruga	 gloss: pig
C: word: mon	 gloss: how
D: word: maik-si	 gloss: wash-NMLZ
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Sentence (with missing item): wati ___ zä zf swa\stem{fiyok}wrmth.
Gloss (with missing item): then ___ PROX IMM STPL:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:DUR/make.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, they were annoying him here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Analogous to the other light verbs, fiyoksi can be used in a \isi{transitive} structure. In example (\ref{ex598}), an infamous sorcerer is annoyed by a few other men. The main semantic contribution to the event comes from the \isi{property noun} the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___', while the \isi{object} indexed in the \isi{light verb} is the sorcerer (\Tsg.\Masc).
A: word: thythy	 gloss: nuisance
B: word: ythama=ma	 gloss: bird.of.paradise=CHAR
C: word: rokar	 gloss: thing
D: word: efoth	 gloss: sun

The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, he came up from the river, he walked. He was about to start hassling the two children ... hassling (them).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The two phasal verbs usually take nominalised verbs as their complements ({\S}\ref{phasalcomplements}), but they can also be supplemented by property nouns with more event-oriented semantics. Hence, they exhibit the same double life as full verbs and light verbs as fiyoksi. Two examples of thkäfsi `start' functioning as a \isi{light verb} are given below. In (\ref{ex599}), a man is trying to enter the house in which two its gloss ___ are hiding. The phasal verb indexes the two its gloss ___, while the semantic content of the event comes solely from the \isi{property noun} zirkn `persistence'.
A: word: nagayé	 gloss: children
B: word: nagaye=dben	 gloss: child=LOC.ANIM.SG
C: word: nge	 gloss: child
D: word: zirkn	 gloss: persistence

Again, the \isi{property noun} the morpheme ___ `sweet-talk' expresses most of the semantics of the event.
A: word: garamgaram	 gloss: sweet.talk
B: word: arammba	 gloss: arammba
C: word: aya	 gloss: oh
D: word: nzä	 gloss: FSG.ABS

The English translation of this sentence is:`Cooking the cassava took all my attention. (lit. `Cassava cooking concentration blocked me.')'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As I have shown above, light verbs (rä- `do', ko- `become', fiyoksi `make', thkäfsi `start' and bthaksi `finish') require semantic assistance from \isi{nominal} predicates. However, \isi{nominal} predicates can be found with other verbs, i.e. full verbs. In the following examples, the concepts of `being concentrated' (\ref{ex601}) and `being locked in' (\ref{ex602}) are expressed by the property nouns the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' and ttw `inertia', respectively. Both meanings could be expressed with light verbs, for example (\ref{ex601}) could be expressed as the morpheme ___ ŋaräré `I am concentrating' (lit. `I am its gloss ___-doing'). The two examples employ full verbs instead, which should be understood as a more idiosyncratic way of speaking.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I point out in {\S}\ref{verbs-sec} that verbs are considered to be a closed \isi{word class} in Komnzo. Part of the argumentation is based on the observation that loanwords, which are verbs in the donor language, commonly end up as property nouns in a \isi{light verb} construction. One such example was shown in (\ref{ex597}) with the \isi{property noun} durua `help', which is a \isi{transitive} verb in Motu (\citealt[61]{Turnerlister:1935motu}). Below, two examples with \ili{English} loans are given. In (\ref{ex603}), the verb fiyoksi indexes the \isi{object} zokwasi `words' (\Stpl), while the \isi{loanword} senis `change' expresses most of the semantics (lit. `I will not change-make the words').
