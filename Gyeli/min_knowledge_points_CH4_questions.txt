The English translation of this sentence is:`Nandtoungou's husband'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In Gyeli, the genitive split is conditioned by the type of possessor noun, distinguishing common nouns and proper names. If the possessor is expressed by a proper name, the genitive marker (\sectref{sec:its gloss ___}) is used, as in \REF{splitits gloss ___1}. If a common noun is used for the possessor instead, as in a parallel construction in \REF{splitits gloss ___2}, the two nouns are linked by an attributive marker.
A: word: ngá	 gloss: GEN
B: word: mí-mbàngá	 gloss: mi4-nut

Sentence (with missing item): ma-kwámɔ́ ___ Nándtùngù
Gloss (with missing item): ma6-bag ___ ∅1.PN
The English translation of this sentence is:`Nandtoungou's bags'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The genitive marker only takes an agreement prefix if the possessee head noun occurs in a plural form, as in \REF{splitGEN3}. Therefore, the genitive marker is conditioned both by the head noun's grammatical number and the dependent noun's status as common or proper noun. The dependent possessor noun determines whether an attributive or a genitive marker is used. The possessee head noun determines number/agreement class marking.

C: word: ngá	 gloss: GEN
D: word: wà	 gloss: 1:ATT
