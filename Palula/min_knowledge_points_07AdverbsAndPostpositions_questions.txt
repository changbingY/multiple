Question 111:
You are a linguist specializing in Palula. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

However, it may serve a~function of emphasising the movement away from (as it does when used with certain adverbs), whether in a~concrete spatial sense, as in (\ref{ex:7-72}), or in an~extended temporal sense, as in (\ref{ex:7-73}), although the latter is not very common.

The first in the sequence is the semantically more central one, whereas the second is a~further fine"=tuning or specification, usually as far as the direction is concerned. Exactly which postpositions can and which cannot be combined in this fashion is a~matter of further research; (\ref{ex:7-93})--(\ref{ex:7-98}) are only a~few illustrative examples. It should be noted that the noun preceding the postpositional sequence is regularly assigned case by the first component of the sequence. The (nominally derived) postposition dúši, itself assigning oblique case to the preceding noun in (\ref{ex:7-96}), receives genitive marking from the second postposiion thíi.
