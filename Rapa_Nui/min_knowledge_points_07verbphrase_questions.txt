I has been characterised as a past tense marker in several descriptions of Rapa Nui and other Polynesian languages.\footnote{\label{fn:320}See \citet[156]{DuFeu1996} for Rapa Nui, \citet{MutuTeìkitutoua2002} for \ili{Marquesan}, \citet[172]{AcadémieTahitienne1986} for \ili{Tahitian}, \citet[34]{Biggs1973} for \ili{Māori}. Note that \citet[153]{Chapin1978} labels Rapa Nui i as perfective.} In non-narrative contexts i is the common aspectual for past events, as the following examples show. As \REF{ex:7.17} shows, it may also express general facts about the past.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As the discussion in \sectref{sec:7.2.5.4} shows, there is a great deal of overlap between e V PVD\is{Demonstrative!postverbal} and \textit{e V {\ꞌ}ā}\is{e (imperfective)!e V {\ꞌ}ā}. Both are used in a habitual\is{Aspect!habitual} and a progressive\is{Progressive} sense; both are found in main and subordinate clauses. Even so, the two cannot always be used interchangeably. One difference lies in the possibility to express additional meaning elements: as shown in \sectref{sec:7.2.5.1}, PVDs\is{Demonstrative!postverbal} do not co-occur with the evaluative particles the morpheme ___ or rō (\sectref{sec:7.4}); in order to use one of these markers in an imperfective clause, \textit{{\ꞌ}ā} must be used instead (see (\ref{ex:7.36}–\ref{ex:7.38}) above).

You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ¿\ꞌI hē tāua ka kimi ___ i te tāua māmari?
Gloss (with missing item): ~at CQ 1DU.INCL CNTG search ___ ACC ART 1DU.INCL egg
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Where will we search for eggs?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In these cases – different from the subordinate clauses in the previous section – the temporal/aspectual reference of the clause is not determined by its relation to surrounding clauses, but independently anchored in the non-linguistic context. For example, \REF{ex:7.50} forms a complete speech, so the sentence has no direct linguistic context. The contiguity mark\is{Contiguity, temporal}er indicates that the event is contiguous to the time of reference, in this case, the moment of speech.

Verbs like \textit{{\ꞌ}ite}, \textit{ŋaro{\ꞌ}a} and the morpheme ___ are clearly active: they are transitive\is{Verb!transitive} verbs, the subject of which can be marked with the agent marker e (\sectref{sec:8.3.1.2}), yet they tend to have the perfect aspect\is{Aspect!perfect} marker\is{Aspect marker}.

And in \REF{ex:7.75}, ‘you won’ means as much as ‘OK, I give in, you win’, i.e. it describes a current situation, not just something which happened in the past.

In these constructions, the morpheme ___ + V indicates an action which is not performed at a certain point in time, but which characterises the preceding noun. The expression has therefore a relatively time-stable character. A few examples:\footnote{\label{fn:341}In \REF{ex:7.88}, the noun is implied: ‘(the ones) given to sleeping’.}

Gloss (with missing item): PFV go_out again ___ DIST DEM men DIST from ART house DIST of DEM old_woman DIST
The English translation of this sentence is:‘When those men came out again of the house of that old woman...’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This apparent exception to the rule may have to do with a general tendency of the verb \textit{e{\ꞌ}a} ‘go out’ to be followed by the morpheme ___ rather than atu. As discussed in \sectref{sec:7.5.2} below, \textit{e{\ꞌ}a} commonly takes the morpheme ___ while it rarely takes atu; a similar tendency is discernible for other motion verbs\is{Verb!motion}. This means that the directional\is{Directional} after \textit{e{\ꞌ}a} tends to point to the destination, the place where the subject is going to, as the centre of attention. In this way it provides the reader/hearer with a subtle signal that this location is significant as the location where the next events are going to happen. Notice that in \REF{ex:7.136} above, \textit{e{\ꞌ}a the morpheme ___} occurs in a cohesive clause, which provides a bridge between the previous scene (in the house) and the next one (in the village). Mai contributes to paving the way for the change of location and the next scene.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘When those men came out again of the house of that old woman...’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Now what if the movement concerns the protagonist himself, i.e. when Huri a Vai himself moves to a different location? \citet[142–143]{Levinsohn2007} points out that in such cases, languages tend to use one of two strategies: the deictic centre is either a fixed geographical location or it is the next location, i.e. the destination of the movement. As it turns out, in Rapa Nui narrative the second strategy is predominant: when the protagonist moves, the morpheme ___ is used to point to the location where the next events are going to happen.\footnote{\label{fn:355}In the preceding section, the same tendency was observed in the story Nuahine Rima Roa; see example \REF{ex:7.136} and discussion.} The following example illustrates this:
A: word: mai	 gloss: hither

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is a clear difference between these two examples: in \REF{ex:7.143}, Huri a Vai is hiding from his enemies, he is lying low to avoid being detected. In \REF{ex:7.144}, Kainga is not just hiding away; he is lying in ambush, waiting for Vaha to come by. In other words, the hiding in \REF{ex:7.143} is self-directed, oriented inwards, while the hiding in \REF{ex:7.144} is outward-looking, with the attention away from the person hiding. It is no coincidence that in the first case mai is used, indicating orientation towards the subject as deictic centre, while in the second case atu is used, pointing away from the subject. In other texts as well, the morpheme ___ mai is commonly used when people its gloss ___ from others, while the morpheme ___ atu is used of people lying in ambush, spying on someone else (cf. \citealt[12]{Fuller1980}). While there is no movement involved, the directionals\is{Directional} indicate \textsc{orientation} with respect to the deictic centre.\footnote{\label{fn:357}\citet[1751]{Hooper2004} discusses a similar function of directionals\is{Directional} in \ili{Tokelauan}. She points out (with reference to \citealt{Jackendoff1983}) that a path (i.e. a directional\is{Directional} movement) may play various roles: an object may traverse a path, but it may also be oriented along a path, facing an entity (in this case, the deictic centre).}

Question 224:
You are a linguist specializing in Rapa Nui. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ¿Pē hē kōrua e ___ era?
Gloss (with missing item): ~like CQ 2PL IPFV ___ DIST
The English translation of this sentence is:‘What were you(pl) talking about?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Other PVDs\is{Demonstrative!postverbal} are only used when there is a specific reason to do so. As discussed above, nei is used when the action is performed by the speaker, takes place close to the speaker, takes place in the present, or is metaphorically proximate in discourse. Likewise, ena can be used when the action is performed by or near to the hearer, takes place at a moderate distance, or at a time somewhat close to the present. This does not mean that nei or ena is always used whenever one of these conditions is fulfilled. Era, being the default PVD\is{Demonstrative!postverbal}, can be used for an action performed by the speaker as in (\ref{ex:7.166}–\ref{ex:7.167}), or an action performed by the hearer as in (\ref{ex:7.168}–\ref{ex:7.169}). In all these cases, however, distance is involved: in (\ref{ex:7.167}–\ref{ex:7.169}) the event takes place in the past; in \REF{ex:7.166} the event is hypothetical, and therefore also removed from the here and now.
