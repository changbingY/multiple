Primarily its function is to derive causatives from derived transitives. Here the person uttering the sentence caused or manipulated his son to make the guests drink tea, thus the initiator of the action is one step further removed from the action as compared to (\ref{ex:8-15}), making the verb in (\ref{ex:8-16}) a~four"=argument verb.

Again, like with valency addition, any inflectional morphology occurs after the derivational suffix: paš-áan-a `are seeing' {\textgreater} pašiǰ-áan-a `are seen', etc. (Compare the transitive (perfective) verb stem ḍhanɡóol- `bury' in (\ref{ex:8-17}) with its corresponding valency"=descreased stem ḍhanɡiǰíl- `be buried' in (\ref{ex:8-18})).
