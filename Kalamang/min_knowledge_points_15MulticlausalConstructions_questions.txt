Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The clitic =tauna links reason to result. It most commonly attaches to \is{demonstrative}demonstrative forms, and then usually the distal form. However, the clitic also has a few occurrences on transitive and intransitive verbs. (\ref{exe:mebarauna}) illustrates =tauna on the distal demonstrative me, which is also marked with \is{focus}focus marker =ba. The example is from a story about diving for lobsters. =tauna serves to link a reason (the subject recognises a good diving spot) to a result (the subject quickly catches a lobster). (\ref{exe:kararaktauna}) shows =tauna on a stative intransitive verb, indicating the reason for suggesting another sailing route. In~(\ref{exe:narauna}), the clitic attaches to a transitive verb, indicating that the fact that the subject (a crow) ate rotten fish is taken not so much as the reason but as proof that it has degraded itself to eating rotten food. That example also shows the combination of a Kalamang and a borrowed conjunction with a slightly different meaning (sehingga `until; so that; with the result that').
A: word: me=ba=tauna	 gloss: DIST={\glba}=so

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The predicate clitic =te marks a predicate as non-final. It can be found on predicates followed by a clause with the same arguments, in which case the arguments are typically left out and the two predicates directly follow each other. In~(\ref{exe:tankin}), tankinkin `to shake hands' is followed by ecie `to return'. The clause following a predicate with =te may also have different arguments. In~(\ref{exe:mure}) and~(\ref{exe:gonggungde}), =te occurs on the last verb of a clause, which is followed by a clause with another subject, but which expresses an event that is related to the event in the first clause. The relation is typically temporal (sequential\is{sequential}) and slightly causal, but note that =te is never obligatory, and that sequentiality and causality may be expressed in other ways (as touched upon earlier in §~\ref{sec:clacomb}). =te is a versatile way of tying states and events together, without forcing a particular reading of the exact relation between the propositions.
