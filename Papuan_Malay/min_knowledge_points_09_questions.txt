Gloss (with missing item): 3SG emerge 3SG=POSS ___ ask 3SG grandfather why
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(when) he (grandfather) emerged, his grandchild asked him, ``grandfather, what happened?'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The possessive marker can be reduced further to \textitbf{=p} ‘\textsc{poss}’, if the \isi{possessor \isi{noun} phrase} ends in a vowel, as in (\ref{Example_9.9}) to (\ref{Example_9.11}). In this case, the marker is cliticized to the possessor. In this type of reduced possessive construction, the possessor is almost always a singular personal \isi{pronoun}, such as short first person \textitbf{sa} ‘\textsc{1sg}’, second person \textitbf{ko} ‘\textsc{2sg}’ in (\ref{Example_9.9}), or short third person \textitbf{de} ‘\textsc{3sg}’ as in (\ref{Example_9.10}). The possessor may, however, also be expressed by a \isi{noun} as in (\ref{Example_9.11}), although in the corpus this example is the only one attested. Again, the same construction is used for alienable and inalienable possession.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In `\textsc{possessor} \textitbf{punya}’ constructions, speakers most commonly employ long \textitbf{punya} ‘\textsc{poss}’, but as shown in (\ref{Example_9.30}) and (\ref{Example_9.31}), constructions with reduced \textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’ are also possible.\footnote{In their analysis of similar possessive constructions in Classical Malay, \citet[157]{Yap.2004} conclude that Classical Malay \textitbf{(em)punya} constructions with omitted possessum denote “pronominal possessive constructions”. More specifically, \citet[7]{Yap.2007} maintains that “in such constructions (em)punya identifies a possessee in relation to its possessor (the genitive function), while at the same time alluding to the morphologically unrealized possessee as well (the pronominal function). Consequently, possessive pronominal (em)punya allows us to focus on the possessor, while still referring to the possessee”. It seems that this analysis is also applicable to Papuan Malay.} Elision of the possessor is unattested.
