Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ ___ PREP call=3SG.OBJ
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I remembered to call her.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Any weak deontic verb may alternatively take a subjunctive clause complement introduced by the subjunctive marker and modal complementiser mék ‘\textsc{sbjv}’ if the main verb is understood to induce a posterior time reference over the complement verb. For example, the complements of the weak deontic verb the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___ to’ may be introduced by fɔ ‘\textsc{prep}’ \REF{ex:key:1390} or by mék ‘\textsc{sbjv}’ \REF{ex:key:1391}. In both sentences below, the main and complement clauses share the same subject{\fff}. However, the subjunctive clauses is more finite – it requires an overt subject. In contrast, the use of a fɔ-complement does not permit the occurrence of an overt subject.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘All these men who have money, that’s what they do.’ or ‘All these men, when they have money, that’s what they do.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The linker the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{sub}’ introduces relative clauses as well as adverbial and coordinate clauses. Since the use of resumptive subject pronouns is very common (but still optional) in subject relative clauses with [+specific] head nouns (cf. \tabref{tab:key:10.3} above), some subject relative clauses may therefore have the same constituent order as an adverbial clause introduced by the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{sub’}. Consider the alternative relative and adverbial translations I provide for sentence \REF{ex:key:1420}:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: However, the meaning of the sentence above is not as ambiguous as it may appear. Relative clauses are never separated from their main clauses by a prosodic break; relative constructions form single prosodic units. In contrast, adverbial clauses are very often separated from their main clauses by a prosodic break: The main clause bears continuative intonation,\is{continuative intonation} and the subordinate clause is separated from the main clause by a pause. The adverbial clause then begins with the high pitch onset that is characteristic for independent utterances (cf. also \sectref{sec:3.4.4}). An adverbial interpretation of the clause introduced by the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{sub’} in \REF{ex:key:1420} above would therefore only be possible if a comma were inserted between mán dɛn ‘men’ and the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{sub’}.

This option is chosen because the subordinate dynamic verb the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is marked for factative TMA, hence it is perfective and bounded:
