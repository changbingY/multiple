Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Mauwake. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Owowa ___ wuailal-ep akia ik-e-k.
Gloss (with missing item): village ___ be.hungry-SS.SEQ banana roast-PA-3s
The English translation of this sentence is: `He went to the village, was hungry and roasted bananas.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A very typical feature in Papuan languages is a difference between final (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.4}) and medial verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5}). The former are finite verbs with full inflection for tense and subject number and person, and the most typical position for them is at the end of a declarative sentence. The medial verbs indicate whether the subject of a clause is the same as \REF{ex:1:x662}, or different from \REF{ex:1:x663}, that of the following clause. The same-subject forms also indicate whether the action of the second verb is simultaneous with that of the first verb, or sequential \REF{ex:1:x662} in relation to it. Medial clauses (\sectref{sec:8.2}) are coordinate with, but also dependent on, the following clause. Because of the existence and extensive use of medial clauses, temporal subordinate clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.3.1}) are used very little in Mauwake.\footnote{Medial clauses in Papuan languages are often translated with temporal subordinate clauses in other languages, even if they are not subordinate in the original language.}
