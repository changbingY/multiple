Gloss (with missing item): ___ other 3s.GEN house face=LOC there pig many 3.DAT be-PA.3s
The English translation of this sentence is: `Another man has many pigs there in front of his house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Because the possessee is typically inanimate and often indefinite whereas the possessor is huits gloss ___ and definite, this causes a violation to the universal discourse-pragmatic principle, according to which animate/huits gloss ___ and definite participants tend to precede inanimate and indefinite participants \citep[135]{Heine1997}. In order to follow the principle, Mauwake often makes the possessor a theme by moving the possessor noun phrase to sentence-initial position. Only the dative pronoun keeps its position immediately preceding the verb \REF{ex:5:x972}. If there is no other possessor \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}, an unmarked pronoun is used as a theme \REF{ex:5:x973}. In these two sentences, moving part of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} to the theme position causes the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} to be non-contiguous. In the example \REF{ex:5:x595} the possessee subject \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aaya} `sugar' is also the theme, and in \REF{ex:5:x1323} the possessee is animate/huits gloss ___, so in those clauses there is less pressure to make the possessor into the theme.

The English translation of this sentence is: `Another man has many pigs there in front of his house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Because the possessee is typically inanimate and often indefinite whereas the possessor is human and definite, this causes a violation to the universal discourse-pragmatic principle, according to which animate/human and definite participants tend to precede inanimate and indefinite participants \citep[135]{Heine1997}. In order to follow the principle, Mauwake often makes the possessor a theme by moving the possessor noun phrase to sentence-initial position.

The English translation of this sentence is: `We do not have a custom like that.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Because the possessee is typically inanimate and often indefinite whereas the possessor is human and definite, this causes a violation to the universal discourse-pragmatic principle, according to which animate/human and definite participants tend to precede inanimate and indefinite participants \citep[135]{Heine1997}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the possessor is not human, the possessive clause is made its gloss ___ the existential verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be' plus a comitative construction rather than the dative pronoun, and the possessor always precedes the possessee \REF{ex:5:x1807}, \REF{ex:5:x1810}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The existential (\sectref{sec:5.5.1}) and possessive clauses (\sectref{sec:5.5.2}) are different from the other verbal clauses with regard to negation.

The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be' is retained only with the verbal negator \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{me}. With all the other negators the negator itself replaces the verb, and the clause becomes a verbless clause:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Neutralization of tense or aspect distinctions, as well as the loss of other than just one argument are common features associated with nominalization \citep[737--738]{HopperEtAl1984}. In Mauwake the nominalized verb forms may keep all of the derivational suffixes but not the inflectional ones, which include tense and person/number marking \REF{ex:5:x1226}.

Gloss (with missing item): man who.CF thus ___ 2s.ACC push-PA-3s

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Mauwake verbs may take a causative suffix, which often indicates causation (\sectref{sec:3.8.4.3.1}). When the causation is less mechanical and requires the cooperation of the object of the causation, the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{suuw}- `push' is used together with a nominalized clause \REF{ex:5:x1252}:
A: word: on-owa	 gloss: do-NMZ

This strategy is used especially when the purpose is understood to be somewhat generic \REF{ex:5:x1253} or when the purpose clause is right-dislocated \REF{ex:5:x1255}.

The English translation of this sentence is: `When/After we go into the house, we do not eat fish soup.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distribution of finite clauses nominalized only with a demonstrative is more restricted than that of clauses with a nominalized verb. They function as complement clauses \REF{ex:5:x1260} (\sectref{sec:8.3.2}), relative clauses \REF{ex:5:x1261} (\sectref{sec:8.3.1}), or temporal clauses \REF{ex:5:x1940} (\sectref{sec:8.3.3.1}), but not in the many other specific functions where the other type can occur. Forming complement clauses and relative clauses by adding a demonstrative pronoun after a finite verb is a common strategy in Papuan languages (\citealt{Reesink1983b}; \citeyear[228]{Reesink1987}; \citealt[77]{Farr1999}; \citealt[192]{Whitehead2004}).
