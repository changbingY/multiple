Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): bäne thu\stem{wä}nzrm fof ... zarfa su\stem{rmän}wrm ___ wä-si=f=nzo.
Gloss (with missing item): DEM:MED STSG:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:DUR/crack fof ... ear STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:DUR/close ___ crack-NMLZ=ERG=ONLY.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He was cracking those (coconut shells) ... This cracking was blocking his ears.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I want to give a few examples, to show that there is a cline of syntactic integration between two clauses. Givón provides a functional explanation to the various degrees of syntactic integration: ``the stronger the semantic bond between two events, the more extensive will be the syntactic integration of the two clauses into a single though complex clause'' (\citeyear[41]{Givon:2001syntax}). As we will see, Komnzo supports this observation to some extent. I choose the domain of `cause' to illustrate this below. The clearest way to mark a causer is by putting the element in the \isi{ergative} case. In Komnzo nominalised verbs can be used in this way (\ref{ex662}). In the example, a \ili{Marind} headhunter tries to distract his victims by imitating the sound that dogs make when chewing bones, but he ends up only distracting himself. The phrase the morpheme ___ wäsifnzo `only that cracking' functions as a clausal \isi{subject}. The event `crack' and the event `close' are tightly integrated. They occur simultthe morpheme ___ously and they stand in direct causal relation.

Sentence (with missing item): komnzo tayo z=wo\stem{rä} ___ fraz-si=ma.
Gloss (with missing item): only weak PROX=FSG:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be ___ extinguish-NMLZ=CHAR.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I am just weak here from extinguishing the fire.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} is used for adverbial adjuncts marking origin and cause. In example (\ref{ex663}), the morpheme ___ frazsi functions as an adverbial \isi{clause}. The predicate `be weak' and the event `extinguish' occurred at different times, but they stand in a causal relation.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Well, she just lived on because of that ... because respected (the taboos). There she is.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Komnzo has a \isi{recognitional} \isi{demonstrative} \isi{pronoun}, which can function in a number of ways ({\S}\ref{recognitional-pronoun-subsec}). It is frequently used in `tip-of-the-tongue' situations. Example (\ref{ex664}) explains why a particular woman in Rouku grew very old, while her friends and some of her children have passed away already. The structure is the same as (\ref{ex663}). The only difference is that the speaker uses the \isi{recognitional} inflected with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} (`because of that one'). After a short pause, he fills in the referent rirksima `because she respected'. The event `survive' (lit. `jump') and the event `respect' occurred in different times, but they stand in a causal relation.
A: word: bäne=ma	 gloss: Recog=CHAR

The English translation of this sentence is:`Well, she just lived on because of that ... because respected (the taboos). There she is.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In discourse, the use of the \isi{recognitional} creates some kind of expectation that something should follow. This something can remain empty, for example when the referent is common ground between the speaker and the addressee, but it can also be `filled in' (\ref{ex664}). This latent expectation explains why the \isi{recognitional} is employed to introduce another clause (\ref{ex665}). The function of that clause is determined by the \isi{case} marker on the \isi{recognitional}. In (\ref{ex665}) it is the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case}, and consequently the function of the following \isi{clause} is to mark a reason, in other words bänema can be translated with `because'. The event in the first clause `exit' and the event in the second clause `close' stand in a causal relationship. However, the causal chain of events involves a number of steps.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Lastly, I want to contrast the use of the \isi{recognitional} from other demonstratives. Consider example (\ref{ex666}), which includes the general \isi{demonstrative} ane in the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} in the second clause. The \isi{demonstrative} ane functions anaphorically, and in that sense it is the mirror image of the \isi{recognitional}. The events `disturb' and `submerge' stand in a causal relationship, but the components are reversed. We can translate it to \ili{English} with `therefore' or `that's why'. The two clauses are otherwise independent. This is also supported by the paragraph marker watik `well, then' which occurs at the beginning of the second clause, but this is optional.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The examples illustrate, that there is a cline between syntactically integrated clauses, i.e. subordinated clauses, and independent clauses. While both ends of the cline are relatively easy to identify, the middle is a grey zone. It is clear that examples like (\ref{ex666}) consists of two independent clauses. Likewise, the nominalised predicates in (\ref{ex662} - \ref{ex664}) are clear cases of \isi{subordination}. But examples like (\ref{ex665}) are somewhat indeterminate. On the one hand, the \isi{recognitional} \isi{pronoun} creates a gap that needs to be filled. In other words, semantically, the second \isi{clause} is subordinated to the first \isi{clause}. On the other hand, the second clause is syntactically independent. Therefore, I refrain from analysing the \isi{recognitional} as a subordinator, but rather as having a connecting function.\footnote{Note that the recognitional demonstrative can be inflected for following cases: characteristic =ma `because', instrumental =me `thereby' and purposive =mr `in order to, until'.}

Question 16:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): keke kwa\stem{mätrak}wrm ___ ... fam z zwä\stem{rmän}th.
Gloss (with missing item): NEG SG:SBJ:PST:DUR/exit ___ ... thought IAM STSG:SBJ>TSG:.F:OBJ:Rpst:PFV/close.
The English translation of this sentence is:`She did not come outside because they had already closed her thoughts (with magic).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The examples illustrate, that there is a cline between syntactically integrated clauses, i.e. subordinated clauses, and independent clauses. While both ends of the cline are relatively easy to identify, the middle is a grey zone. It is clear that examples like (\ref{ex666}) consists of two independent clauses. Likewise, the nominalised predicates in (\ref{ex662} - \ref{ex664}) are clear cases of \isi{subordination}. But examples like (\ref{ex665}) are somewhat indeterminate. On the one hand, the \isi{recognitional} \isi{pronoun} creates a gap that needs to be filled. In other words, semantically, the second \isi{clause} is subordinated to the first \isi{clause}. On the other hand, the second clause is syntactically independent.

The English translation of this sentence is:`We make a bamboo ring ... for pressing down (the membrane).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purposive adverbials are found in different construction. Example (\ref{ex698}) is from a procedural about making a drum. The speaker explains how a bamboo ring will hold the membrane in place after it is glued to the drum.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Sometimes, we scrape (the root of) this one here for poisoning the waterholes.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example (\ref{ex699}), the speaker shows me a particular tree used for poison-root fishing. The example shows that the \isi{purposive} \isi{clause} can take an \isi{object} by forming a compound `for swamp poisoning' > `to poison the swamp'. Note that the \isi{recognitional} \isi{pronoun} is used just before the nominalised verb.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Sometimes, we scrape (the root of) this one here for poisoning the waterholes.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example (\ref{ex699}), the speaker shows me a particular tree used for poison-root fishing. The example shows that the \isi{purposive} \isi{clause} can take an \isi{object} by forming a compound `for its gloss ___ poisoning' > `to poison the its gloss ___'. Note that the \isi{recognitional} \isi{pronoun} is used just before the nominalised verb.

Sentence (with missing item): wati far ane thd=en sf\stem{räz}rmth ___ kwim ŋad=me sf\stem{mthzg}wrmth.
Gloss (with missing item): then post DEM middle=LOC STPL:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:DUR/erect ___ kwim rope=INS STPL:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:DUR/encircle.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, they were erecting a post in the middle in order to wrap around the kwim (Acacia mangium) rope.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purposive clauses can also be less syntactically integrated and form an independent \isi{clause}. In this case, they are usually introduced by the \isi{recognitional} flagged with \isi{purposive} \isi{case} the morpheme ___, which I translate with `in order to'. Example (\ref{ex700}) describes a tall structure used to show off the amount of a group's yams harvest. This structure involved a long post around which many layers of yam tubers were tied with thick rope.

The English translation of this sentence is:`In the meantime our father died ... and from then one we don't know with whom (the rain stones) are today.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Fthémäsü is not a subordinator because it can be used on independent clauses with the translation `in the meantime'. In example (\ref{ex692}), the speaker explains that after his father's death, the stones for rain-making were lost.
A: word: nzenme	 gloss: FNSG.POSS

The English translation of this sentence is:`When you return in the holidays, then you have say: ``He is there!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A third strategy to connect a \isi{clause} temporally is by using the \isi{recognitional} inflected with the \isi{locative} case bafen. But this is an infrequent strategy because (i) the \isi{temporal} function is an extension of the \isi{locative} case and (ii) connecting clauses is only one function of the \isi{recognitional}. Example (\ref{ex693}) is about two men from Rouku who used to work on the Fly River. They run into another man from Rouku, who has been away for a long time. The \isi{recognitional} occurs twice. First, is it coreferential with holiday: `in that time ... during the holidays'. The second use is difficult to analyse because this is also a \isi{temporal}/\isi{conditional} construction, but one can assume that bafen introduces the second clause.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ gon z ze\stem{faf}.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ hip IAM STSG:SBJ:Rpst:PFV/hold.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He held hips while rejoicing' or `He held hips rejoicingly.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{proprietive} and \isi{instrumental} case on a nominalised verb can be used to express a manner adverbial \isi{clause}. In the functional extension, the two case markers can also express a relation of association and \isi{temporal} overlaps respectively. Hence, the nominalised verb flagged with the \isi{proprietive} case in example (\ref{ex694}) can be translated as `He held hips while rejoicing' or `He held hips rejoicingly.'
A: word: thwek-si=karä	 gloss: rejoice-NMLZ=PROP

The English translation of this sentence is:`Some station people gathered there. They were standing thinking: ``Will it float or will it sink?'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{recognitional} \isi{case} also serves to introduce a clause which expresses a manner (or \isi{temporal} association). In example (\ref{ex695}), the speaker explains how he and his friends were loading a heavy sago stem on a canoe. Some people from Morehead Station were sceptical about this plan. Thus, bäneme thfkogrm `They were standing with/like this' connects to the following clause which expresses `They stood thinking ...'.
A: word: bäne=me	 gloss: Recog=INS

The English translation of this sentence is:`Now we are putting (the pictures) down how it goes there ... how the story should be.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The most common way to encode a manner adverbial is by a \isi{relative clause} with mon or monme `how' ({\S}\ref{relclauses}). Example (\ref{ex696}) is taken from a picture task, where the participants were asked to arrange picture cards into a story. In the example, the speaker explains the task to a bystander. Note that the \isi{recognitional} bäneme `with this, in this way' also appears in the first clause. The second \isi{recognitional} bäne refers to trikasi `story' as we can see in the last clause.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I said: ``He is shouting out there. This man who bothers me.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I begin by describing the formal structure of relative clauses. Formally, they are similar to content questions because the relative pronouns are identical to the interrogative pronouns.\footnote{I refer the reader to {\S}\ref{interrogatives-sec} for a description of interrogative pronouns. See especially \tabref{interrogatives-table}, but also the interrogatives in \tabref{demonstratives-table}.} We could say that interrogatives function as relative pronouns, which is why I do not \isi{gloss} them as \textsc{rel} in the following examples. Instead, I \isi{gloss} them in the same manner, in which pronouns in interrogative function are glossed. However, relative clauses are semantically distinct from content questions because the answer to the question is already given in the form of the NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}}. Relative clauses are also syntactically different from content questions in that the relative \isi{pronoun} has to occur as the second element (\figref{relclause}). Such a restriction does not apply to content questions. This is illustrated in (\ref{ex541}-\ref{ex543}), where the \isi{relative clause} in each example is printed in bold face.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I begin by describing the formal structure of relative clauses. Formally, they are similar to content questions because the relative pronouns are identical to the interrogative pronouns.\footnote{I refer the reader to {\S}\ref{interrogatives-sec} for a description of interrogative pronouns. See especially \tabref{interrogatives-table}, but also the interrogatives in \tabref{demonstratives-table}.} We could say that interrogatives function as relative pronouns, which is why I do not \isi{gloss} them as \textsc{rel} in the following examples. Instead, I \isi{gloss} them in the same manner, in which pronouns in interrogative function are glossed. However, relative clauses are semantically distinct from content questions because the answer to the question is already given in the form of the NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}}. Relative clauses are also syntactically different from content questions in that the relative \isi{pronoun} has to occur as the second element (\figref{relclause}). Such a restriction does not apply to content questions. This is illustrated in (\ref{ex541}-\ref{ex543}), where the \isi{relative clause} in each example is printed in bold face.

Question 33:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): nze nima b=yan\stem{nor} ane kabe fof ___ maf won\stem{rsokn}wr.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I said: ``He is shouting out there. This man who bothers me.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex541}) comes from a hunting story where the narrator had encountered a spirit which began chasing him. In the example, the relative \isi{pronoun} maf follows the \isi{pronoun} the morpheme ___. The \isi{relative clause} follows the NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}} ane kabe `that man'.

Gloss (with missing item): FNSG but DEM FPL:SBJ>TSG.F:OBJ:PST:DUR/look ___ side=LOC which(ABS) TSG.F:SBJ:PST:DUR/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`But we were looking at that (fire), which was on the side of the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example (\ref{ex542}), the speaker describes why he did not pay attention to a fire that almost burned his garden. In the example, the relative \isi{pronoun} mane is preceded by the \isi{noun phrase} the morpheme ___ tharthar `side of the its gloss ___'. This is an adjoined \isi{relative clause} because it is outside the NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}}, which in this case is mni `fire', whose antecedent is understood from the context.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I should have pulled that tree (from the fence), which the tree was pushing down. No, (I was) not (strong) enough!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Finally, in (\ref{ex543}) the speaker describes how he was trying to remove a burning tree from his garden fence. The relative \isi{pronoun} mane follows the \isi{ergative} marked wämne `tree'. This is an adjoined \isi{relative clause} because it is outside the matrix NP, which in this case is ŋarake `garden fence', whose antecedent is understood from the context.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Sukawi, it is not like that. This is from that time ... really this man whose picture we just saw before.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A second rule is needed for examples where the relative \isi{pronoun} occurs in initial position of the \isi{relative clause}. Although this is possible, such examples are much less frequent than the second position. The relative \isi{pronoun} can occur in first position only (i) if it is preceded by the NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}} (\ref{ex544} and \ref{ex545}), or (ii) if the only other element in the \isi{relative clause} is the verb (\ref{ex546}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex544}) is taken from a picture stimulus task. One of the participants is correcting the other. Note that the \ili{English} translation is misleading. The noun phrase mafanemäwä waniwani is a complex noun phrase and the relative \isi{pronoun} mafanema is marked flagged with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} in adnominal function. Thus, mafanemäwä waniwani should be translated not as \isi{genitive} `whose picture', but as origin `picture of/about who'.

Sentence (with missing item): kma wämne ane fof kwa\stem{kark}wé ane fof ___ mane thä\stem{narf}a ... keke watik-thé=märe.
Gloss (with missing item): Pot tree DEM EMPH FSG:SBJ:Rpst:IPFV/pull DEM EMPH ___ which(ABS) SG:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:IPFV/press.down ... NEG enough-Adlzr=PRIV.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I should have pulled that tree (from the fence), which the tree was pushing down. No, (I was) not (strong) enough!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is harder to determine the argument role of NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}} because its presence is optional. We saw in (\ref{ex543}) that the relative \isi{pronoun} mane referred to the fence, which the burning tree had pushed down. But this is not expressed by a noun phrase, nor is the fence indexed in the verb of the \isi{matrix clause}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`But we were looking at that (fire), which was on the side of the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is harder to determine the argument role of NP\textsubscript{\textsc{mat}} because its presence is optional. We saw in (\ref{ex543}) that the relative \isi{pronoun} mane referred to the fence, which the burning tree had pushed down.

The English translation of this sentence is:`It is up to you which one you choose!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is also possible that the \isi{relative clause} is free in the sense that it refers to the whole \isi{matrix clause} and not to a particular \isi{nominal} (\citealt[213]{Andrews:2007relclauses}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`She just lives on ... because of her respect ... she was respecting (the law) ... but those who did not respect (the law) ... well, they grew old quickly and they got sick.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example (\ref{ex555}), the speaker talks about food taboos. He makes the point that a particular woman in the village has grown very old because she has always respected those food taboos. The \isi{relative clause} (in bold) marks a shift in topic to all those people who did not respect the food taboos. The antecedent of the \isi{relative clause} is omitted, since it is understood from context. It is different from the old woman, as can been seen by that fact that all following verbs index a plural argument, e.g. kwarirkwrmth `they respected' and thufathwrm `it grabbed them'.
A: word: mafa	 gloss: who.NSG.ERG
