Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ ʑo tɤ-ndzur
Gloss (with missing item): ___ EMPH AOR-stand
The English translation of this sentence is:`He stood up suddenly, and [appeared to be] very tall.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Pattern I, which consists of the bare ideophonic root, is combined with predicates in the Aorist or Inferential to express an action occurring suddenly, as in (\ref{ex:ideo1}). The form \forme{the morpheme ___} means that the action of the sentence resulted in the main referent becoming taller than its surrounding.
A: word: zjaŋ	 gloss: IDPH(I):tall
B: word: zjaŋzjaŋ	 gloss: IDPH(II):tall
C: word: zjaŋnɤlaŋ	 gloss: IDPH(IV):tall
D: word: mɤlɤzjaŋ	 gloss: IDPH(VI):tall

Sentence (with missing item): mbro ɯ-taʁ to-ɕe tɕe ___ jɤ-ari-ndʑi
Gloss (with missing item): horse 3SG-on IFR:UP-go LNK ___ AOR-go[II]-DU
The English translation of this sentence is:`He mounted the horse, and they went there, very tall.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Pattern III is formed by reduplicating the ideophonic root with the additive marker \forme{nɤ} (§\ref{sec:additive.nA}) inserted in between. It depicts a rhythmic action or a constant motion as in (\ref{ex:ideo3}), depending on the semantics of the root.

Sentence (with missing item): a-ɣe ___ ʑo tʰɯ-aβzu
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.POSS-grandson ___ EMPH AOR-become
The English translation of this sentence is:`My grandson has become very tall.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Pattern VI, with the root prefixed by \forme{mɤlɤ\trt}, describes a state like pattern II, but differs from it in that it expresses a higher degree. In addition, it can be used to express the result of a change of state with the verb \japhug{aβzu}{become, grow} as in (\ref{ex:ideo6}). It is the rarest of all ideophonic patterns, not attested in the Japhug text corpus.

The English translation of this sentence is:`People call it `Shwaba rwa'bum', it is [a kind of deer antler] with only one [branch], short and thick.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples (\ref{ex:zJAGzJAG.ma}) and (\ref{ex:ndzArndzAr.ma}) are incontrovertible evidence that ideophones can serve as noun modifier: in (\ref{ex:zJAGzJAG.ma}) is embedded within an exceptive (§\ref{sec:exceptive}) postpositional phrase which does not contain any verb, and must be analyzed as modifier of the counted noun \forme{tɯ-rdoʁ} `one piece'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I acted this way, I created a huge and deep forest on the top of whose trees birds are tweeting and chirping and flying around.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Ideophones convey rich and intricate meanings in a succinct way. In traditional stories, their use contributes to the vividness of the description. For instance, in (\ref{ex:ndArndAr}), the choice of the pattern II \forme{the morpheme ___} `huge and imposing' and the pattern III \forme{ɲcɣɤnɤɲcɣɤt} `loud and moving around' evokes a much more expressive picture than the translation provided here in plain language. Native speakers, upon hearing such a sentence, visualize the vivid picture of huge lush trees and flocks of birds flying around, tweeting and chirping.

However, this not a morphosyntactic constraint, and \forme{kʰi} can in principle be combined with verbs in other TAME categories, such as the Factual (§\ref{sec:factual}) in (\ref{ex:cha.khi}) (\forme{the morpheme ___} rather than the Sensory \forme{ɲɯ-the morpheme ___}), confirming Tournadre and LaPolla's (\citeyear{tournadre14evidentiality}) insight of the necessity of distinguishing source and access to information when describing evidential systems.
