The English translation of this sentence is:‘as the boss had already left for Sarmi in the morning, oh no, damn it!, the two of us were forced to walk on foot’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Affixation with \textscItal{ter-} ‘\textsc{acl}’ derives \isi{monovalent} verbs from verbal bases. The derived verbs denote accidental or unintentional actions or events, as shown in (\ref{Example_3.1}). This derivation process appears to be somewhat productive in Papuan Malay, as discussed below.
A: word: br–angkat	 gloss: VBLZ\textbf{–}leave
B: word: angkat	 gloss: lift
C: word: dia	 gloss: 3SG
D: word: jatu	 gloss: fall

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG say mother 1SG see tree D.PROX 3SG ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘she said, ``mama, I saw this tree, it was shaking'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The derived verbs denote accidental or unintentional states, processes, or actions. The term “accidental” covers “such concepts as involuntary, unmotivated, agentless, sudden, and unexpected action (or state resulting therefrom)”, employing \citegen[150]{Adelaar.1992} terminology. Hence, \textscItal{ter-} is glossed as ‘\textsc{acl}’ (‘accidental’). Two \textscItal{ter-}prefixed items are given in context: \textitbf{tagoyang} ‘be shaken’ in (\ref{Example_3.2}) and \textitbf{tertutup} ‘be closed’ in (\ref{Example_3.4}). Both examples, together with the one in (\ref{Example_3.3}), illustrate how \textscItal{ter-} decreases \isi{valency} by “removing agent-like participants”.

The same consultant also stated that Papuan Malay speakers usually employ the respective bases rather than the prefixed forms. One such contrastive set of examples is given in (\ref{Example_3.5}) and (\ref{Example_3.6}). Instead of using the prefixed form \textitbf{terpengaru} ‘be influenced’, as in (\ref{Example_3.5}), speakers more often employ the base \textitbf{pengaru} ‘influence’ in the sense of ‘be influenced’, as in (\ref{Example_3.6}).

Both examples, along with the example in (\ref{Example_3.9}), show that the verbal \isi{valency} is not further decreased and that the derivation does not result in a loss of agentivity. That is, the referents of the derived verbs \textitbf{terjatu} ‘be dropped, fall’ and \textitbf{terlambat} ‘be late’ and the referents of the bases \textitbf{jatu} ‘fall’ and \textitbf{lambat} ‘be slow’, respectively, have the same semantic functions.

Gloss (with missing item): 3PL NEG ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(nowadays), they don’t steal (emph)!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Four of the prefixed lexemes listed in \tabref{Table_3.11a} and \tabref{Table_3.11b} are nouns that can also receive an intensified verbal reading: \textitbf{pamalas} ‘be very listless’ as in (\ref{Example_3.26}), \textitbf{pencuri} ‘steal (\textsc{emph})’ as in (\ref{Example_3.27}), \textitbf{panakut} ‘be very fearful (of)’ as in (\ref{Example_3.28}), and \textitbf{pandiam} ‘be very quiet’ as in (\ref{Example_3.29}). In (\ref{Example_3.26}) \textitbf{pamalas} ‘be very listless’ receives a verbal reading given that a nominal reading of \textitbf{pamalas kerja} ‘the lazy males work’ is inappropriate. In (\ref{Example_3.27}), \textitbf{pencuri} ‘steal (\textsc{emph})’ has verbal function as only verbs are negated with \textitbf{tra} ‘\textsc{neg}’ (see §\ref{Para_5.3.6} and §\ref{Para_13.1.1}). In (\ref{Example_3.28}) \textitbf{panakut} ‘be very fearful (of)’ functions as a \isi{verb}, which is intensified with \textitbf{sampe} ‘reach’. The utterance in (\ref{Example_3.29}) is ambiguous, as \textitbf{pandiam} can receive the nominal reading ‘taciturn person’ or the verbal reading ‘be very quiet’.
A: word: pen–curi	 gloss: AG–steal
B: word: pencuri	 gloss: thief/steal
C: word: pen–datang	 gloss: AG–come

The English translation of this sentence is:[Conversation about problems of a church congregation:] ‘(all) burdens (and) problems (that) it has, (the congregation) needs ... has to be prayed for’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Second, the exchange in (\ref{Example_3.57}) suggests that the high frequency items listed in \tabref{Table_3.17a} and \tabref{Table_3.17b} may well have non-compositional semantics for Papuan Malay speakers. In a conversation about religious affairs, the speaker produced \textitbf{diberdoa} ‘be prayed for’. This item is ungrammatical in both Papuan Malay and \ili{Standard Indonesian}. Papuan Malay does not have a morphologically marked undergoer voice. The \ili{Standard Indonesian} undergoer voice marker \textitbf{di}- cannot co-occur with prefix \textitbf{ber}-, but always replaces it. This example suggests that the speaker perceives \textitbf{berdoa} ‘pray’ as a monomorphemic word to which she affixed the Indonesian undergoer voice marker \textitbf{di}- in an attempt to approximate Indonesian.
A: word: di–ber–doa	 gloss: UV–VBLZ–prayer

Gloss (with missing item): so ___ live child D.DIST still exist
The English translation of this sentence is:‘so her child lives, that child still exists’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Suffix \textitbf{-nya} ‘\textsc{3possr}’ is typically attached to nominal bases to indicate possessive relations, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_3.58}). In addition, a considerable number of suffixed lexemes have verbal bases, while a small number of lexemes have prepositional, adverbial, \isi{locative}, or \isi{demonstrative} bases. However, \isi{affixation} with \textitbf{-nya} ‘\textsc{3possr}’ is not used as a productive derivation device in Papuan Malay.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Derived words with token frequencies of five or more are listed in \tabref{Table_3.18}. All but two of the derived lexemes are low frequency words (80 items, attested with less than 20 tokens). Besides, the token frequencies for the respective bases are (much) higher for most of the derived words (65 lexemes). Of the 82 suffixed lexemes, 76 were tentatively classified as borrowings from \ili{Standard Indonesian} (SI-borrowings) (for details see language internal factor (\ref{List_3.1.f}) in §\ref{Para_3.1.1}, p. \pageref{List_3.1.f}); in \tabref{Table_3.18} these items are underlined.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ Madga
Gloss (with missing item): ___ Madga
The English translation of this sentence is:‘her name is Madga’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The low token frequencies for the derived lexemes result from the fact that Papuan Malay speakers usually use an alternative strategy to express possessive relations. Instead of suffixing \textitbf{-nya} to a \isi{nominal base}, Papuan Malay encodes \isi{adnominal possession} by an analytical construction with \textitbf{punya}, or reduced \textitbf{pu}, ‘\textsc{poss}’ (see \chapref{Para_9}). The ``\textitbf{punya} #'' column in \tabref{Table_3.18} lists the token frequencies for adnominal possessive constructions with \textitbf{punya}/\textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’. Examples are given in (\ref{Example_3.59}) and (\ref{Example_3.60}).

Sentence (with missing item): ___ pu nama Martin
Gloss (with missing item): ___ POSS name Martin
The English translation of this sentence is:‘his name is Martin’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The low token frequencies for the the morpheme ___rived lexemes result from the fact that Papuan Malay speakers usually use an alternative strategy to express possessive relations.

The ``\textitbf{punya} #'' column in \tabref{Table_3.18} lists the token frequencies for adnominal possessive constructions with \textitbf{punya}/\textitbf{pu} ‘\textsc{poss}’.
