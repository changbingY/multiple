Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Before examining \isi{coordination} between clauses, I consider how elements within \isi{phrase}s may be coordinated, starting with nouns within a \isi{noun phrase}. Nouns are coordinated within a \isi{noun phrase}s without any overt \isi{conjunction} or \isi{morphosyntactic} marking to indicate \isi{conjunction}. When the total \isi{number} of referents among the coordinated nouns in the NP equals two, then the entire NP may receive \isi{dual} subject marking or \isi{object marking}. When the total \isi{number} of referents is more than two, then the NP may receive \isi{plural} subject marking or \isi{object marking}. Examples \REF{ex:complex:1} through \REF{ex:complex:5} illustrate NPs in which two nouns are coordinated.

Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ pig ___ food 3PL=cook-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`Alimban killed the pig and cooked the meat.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If a sentence contains two verbs that have different objects, then it is assumed that the \isi{coordination} occurs not between two verbs within a single \isi{verb phrase} but rather between two \isi{verb phrase}s. However, it is not always clear whether there are two \isi{verb phrase}s being coordinated within a single clause or there are two clauses being coordinated within a larger sentence. This is because it is common in Ulwa to omit subjects (\sectref{sec:11.1}). Thus, although example \REF{ex:complex:23} is translated as though the \isi{coordination} occurs within a single clause, it could alternatively be the case that there are two full clauses being coordinated, but that the subject in the second clause is omitted (i.e., ‘Alimban killed the pig and [he] cooked the meat’).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Subordinate clauses marked with the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’ are used extensively in the rhetorical structure known as tail-head linkage, whereby the final clause of one sentence is more or less repeated at the start of the following sentence. In these structures, the \isi{final verb} of the first sentence is fully repeated somewhere in the first clause of the second sentence (i.e., it has the same exact \isi{object marker} and \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}); the addition of the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’, however, allows the clause with the repeated verb to serve as a transition into a new \isi{independent clause}. In tail-head linkage constructions, it is possible for the entire pivot to be repeated exactly, as in \REF{ex:complex:65}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Subordinate clauses marked with the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’ are used extensively in the rhetorical structure known as tail-head linkage, whereby the final clause of one sentence is more or less repeated at the start of the following sentence. In these structures, the \isi{final verb} of the first sentence is fully repeated somewhere in the first clause of the second sentence (i.e., it has the same exact \isi{object marker} and \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}); the addition of the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’, however, allows the clause with the repeated verb to serve as a transition into a new \isi{independent clause}. In tail-head linkage constructions, it is possible for the entire pivot to be repeated exactly, as in \REF{ex:complex:65}.

Sentence (with missing item): umbe ___ lamndu
Gloss (with missing item): tomorrow ___ pig
The English translation of this sentence is:`The pig will be killed tomorrow.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are no \isi{correlative relative clause}s in Ulwa, nor are there \isi{adjoined relative clause}s (i.e., \isi{non-adjacent relative clause}s).\footnote{In an alternative analysis relative clauses in Ulwa may be considered \is{head-internal relative clause} head-internal, with the \isi{head} being expressed as a full NP only within the \isi{relative clause}, namely postverbally. A schematization of the head-internal analysis is given in \REF{ex:syntax:278} in \sectref{sec:13.7}. In this analysis, relative clauses would exhibit a different \isi{word order} from that found in most Ulwa clauses: whereas the \isi{word order} of \isi{pragmatic}ally neutral \is{active voice} active clauses is S(O)V (\sectref{sec:11.1}), the \isi{word order} of relative clauses would be (O)VS. While this analysis seems typologically unusual, it perhaps has some support when considered alongside Ulwa’s \isi{passive} constructions (\sectref{sec:13.7}). However, it does not seem best to analyze the \isi{head} as being internal, since it takes grammatical marking according to its role in the \isi{matrix clause}, not according to what its role would be within the \isi{embedded clause}. For example, we find the \isi{object marker} ma= ‘\textsc{3sg.obj}’ as opposed to the \isi{subject marker} mï ‘\textsc{3sg.subj}’ in sentences such as \REF{ex:complex:82}. Thus, it seems best to me to analyze relative clauses, like other subordinate clauses, as maintaining canonical S(O)V order and employing a \isi{gap strategy}.}
