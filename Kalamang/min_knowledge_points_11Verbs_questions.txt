Sentence (with missing item): kiet=i koyet ma se ___
Gloss (with missing item): defecate=PLNK finish 3SG IAM ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`After defecating, he returned.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: (\ref{exe:kieri}) and~(\ref{exe:koinani}) show the morpheme ___ and yecie\footnote{The fact that the form with -n does not carry y- and vice versa may be related to them having different stress patterns: ˈyecie vs eˈcien. All ``uninflected'' verbs with -n carry stress on the last syllable, even if the verb without -n carries stress on the first (e.g. ˈpotma vs potˈman `to cut', ˈparuo vs paˈruon `to do', ˈosie vs oˈsien) but yecie is the only one with a difference in initial vowel. Syllable weight does not normally play a role in stress assignment in Kalamang (as described in~§\ref{sec:stress}).} in very similar environments: both describe the actions of a third person in a narrative, both follow the iamitive he, and both conclude a paragraph in the narrative where different actions were listed.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Directional verbs are verbs that express movement in a specific direction, end in -a and are irregular. The subclass of directional verbs distinguishes itself from other verbs in several other ways. All verbs belonging to the class are given in Table~\ref{tab:dirall}. When combined with locative =ko, as in~(\ref{exe:dirko}), directional verbs precede the locative, whereas other verbs follow it. Of all verbs, only directional verbs can carry the \is{causative}causative proclitic di=, illustrated in~(\ref{exe:dirdi}). They also have a special imperative ending in -ei, in contrast to other verbs, which carry imperative =te (example~\ref{exe:dirimp}). Although they can stand on their own, directional verbs are commonly used in \is{predicate!complex}complex predicates; and of all Kalamang complex predicates the majority involve a directional verb (see Chapter~\ref{ch:svc}). Many of the directional verbs end in -ra, including the rather generic ra `to move (away)', suggesting these verbs are diachronically related and perhaps have been part of a paradigm involving the directional verb -ra. The way speakers use directional verbs when talking about travelling by sea from Karas island is described in §\ref{sec:elevdem}.

Sentence (with missing item): mu sontum=at kome ___ mian
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL person=OBJ look ___ come
The English translation of this sentence is:`They looked at the people coming and going.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Six of the seven verbs can be divided into opposite pairs: sara `to ascend' and bara `to descend', masara `to move towards land' and marua `to move towards sea', and mia `to come' and ra `to move away'. These pairs may occur together to indicate a back-and-forth movement. The verb pairs sathe morpheme ___-bathe morpheme ___, mathe morpheme ___-maruan and the morpheme ___-mian (note that they all carry final -n, although it is unclear why) are illustrated in~(\ref{exe:sathe morpheme ___bathe morpheme ___}) to (\ref{exe:the morpheme ___mian}). There is no dedicated opposite of era `to move uphill; to ascend diaits gloss ___nally'. Instead, bara `to descend' is the opposite of both sara `to ascend (vertically)' and era. However, era and bara are never used as an opposite pair in the same clause, whereas sara and bara are.

The verb pairs saran-baran, maran-maruan and ran-the morpheme ___ (note that they all carry final -n, although it is unclear why) are illustrated in~(\ref{exe:saranbaran}) to (\ref{exe:ranthe morpheme ___}). There is no dedicated opposite of era `to move uphill; to ascend diagonally'. Instead, bara `to descend' is the opposite of both sara `to ascend (vertically)' and era. However, era and bara are never used as an opposite pair in the same clause, whereas sara and bara are.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] help him, put up his basket, fill it with avocados.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The causative proclitic di= (§\ref{sec:di}), which indicates movement towards a goal, often occurs on directional verbs. It can usually be translated with `put' in combination with a directional verb, such as di=sara `put up' in~(\ref{exe:dirdi}). Di= is not found with era `to go up diagonally' or mia `to come'. With ra `to move (away), di= creates the specific meaning `to put up; to install'. This is illustrated in~(\ref{exe:salat}).
A: word: di=saran	 gloss: CAUS=ascend
B: word: di=saran=i	 gloss: CAUS=ascend=PLNK

Sentence (with missing item): ma [...] bo amdir=ka bo ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG {} go garden=LAT go ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`She goes to the garden to dig up food.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: While there is one noun that cannot be the object of a verb but instead must be incorporated, don `thing', there are also restrictions on which elements can be incorporated. Pronouns, \is{demonstrative}demonstratives and modified nouns cannot be incorporated. As for the verbs, intransitive verbs cannot incorporate. Incorporation can take place on verbs that are part of a complex predicate\is{predicate!complex}. Both the first and the second verb in such a construction may incorporate, as (\ref{exe:jiena}) and (\ref{exe:bomuapruo}) illustrate.
A: word: muap-ruo	 gloss: food-dig

Sentence (with missing item): Nur an=at gonggung=te tok ___
Gloss (with missing item): Nur 1SG=OBJ call={\glte} first ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Nur calls me to have breakfast first.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is unclear what the semantic or pragmatic difference is between incorporated and non-incorporated noun-verb pairs, and thus it remains for further research what guides the choice between incorporating or not incorporating. Some incorporations are more abstract expressions. Ter-na `its gloss ___', for example, does not necessarily mean `drinking tea', but can also mean `having breakfast'. Incorporations with tree names and sara `to ascend' mean `to climb that tree in order to harvest'. However, we also find object + verb pairs with the same nouns and verbs which also have the more abstract meanings, suggesting that incorporation is not a requirement for the abstract reading. This is illustrated in~(\ref{exe:terincorp}). In~(\ref{exe:teratna}), the speaker first uses ter `tea' as the object and na `consume' as the verb. Two turns later, in~(\ref{exe:terna}), he incorporates ter into na with the same meaning, `to have breakfast'. (\ref{exe:ternatnin}) shows that negation does not play a role in the difference between~(\ref{exe:teratna}) and~(\ref{exe:terna}), and that ter may be incorporated in na also when the verb is negated.
A: word: ter-na	 gloss: tea-consume
B: word: ter-nan=i	 gloss: tea-consume=PLNK
C: word: ter	 gloss: tea
D: word: sarat=et	 gloss: ascend=IRR

The English translation of this sentence is:`She came herself.' (Lit. `She brought herself coming.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The corpus contains only eight examples of constructions with the reflexive prefix un-, four of which are in combination with the restricting pronoun marker -tain (which may or may not be focused). These constructions occur with five different verbs: balaok `to show' (three occurrences), deir `to bring' (two occurrences), ganggie `to lift', kajie `to pick' and rua `to kill' (each one occurrence). Three of eight occurrences have the reflexive verb as the first verb in a \is{predicate!complex}complex predicate linked with predicate linker =i. (\ref{exe:undeiri}) shows un-deir `to bring oneself'. (\ref{exe:unruani}), with un-rua `to kill oneself', is from a recording made during net fishing, where one of the speakers describes the movements of a needlefish in or close to the net.\footnote{Four words in the lexicon might contain a fossilised prefix un-.

In elicited reflexive examples, one encounters this strategy again, without the use of diri `self', suggesting that these restricting pronouns can also have a reflexive interpretation. Consider~(\ref{exe:andainawaruo}), where an-tain `I alone' is used to express `myself'. This example is ambiguous between a reflexive and a restrictive \is{focus!pronominal}focus meaning. It could also mean `It is I who washes'.\footnote{This construction was elicited with a picture of child washing its own hair, which was contrasted with a picture of a mother bathing a child.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note that in the latter example, the subject pronoun an `I' is also inflected with the restricting pronoun marker -tain (§\ref{sec:alonepron}), like in~(\ref{exe:undeiri}) and~(\ref{exe:unruani}). In elicited reflexive examples, one encounters this strategy again, without the use of diri `self', suggesting that these restricting pronouns can also have a reflexive interpretation. Consider~(\ref{exe:andainawaruo}), where an-tain `I alone' is used to express `myself'. This example is ambiguous between a reflexive and a restrictive \is{focus!pronominal}focus meaning. It could also mean `It is I who washes'.\footnote{This construction was elicited with a picture of child washing its own hair, which was contrasted with a picture of a mother bathing a child. Showing the picture was accompanied by a request for a translation of Malay anak mandi diri `the child bathes itself' and saya mandi diri `I bathe myself'.}

Gloss (with missing item): ___ hair-1SG.POSS=OBJ brush
The English translation of this sentence is:`I brush my own hair.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Quantifying pronoun marker -tain can also be used when a subject carries out an action upon a part of itself, and the referent is thus not exactly the same, as in~(\ref{exe:westalan}). In the corpus, this kind of construction without use of -tain occurs, illustrated in~(\ref{exe:nakalan}). This suggests that -tain is neither sufficient nor necessary to make a reflexive construction.

Gloss (with missing item): 3PL food=OBJ ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`They exchange food with each other.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the Reciprocal constructions and situation type field stimulus kit\is{stimulus} \parencite{evans2004}, which consists of short video clips that speakers are asked to describe, nau= was applied to events of hugging, chasing, hitting and exchanging where more than two people were acting upon each other in a unidirectional chain, pairwise, radially or mixed. The reciprocal proclitic is also used for asymmetrical actions, i.e. actions that one group or individual do(es) to another, but not vice versa (for example one person shaking others' hands, one person giving things to several others, a person chasing another who is being chased by a third). It can also be used for sequentially reciprocal events (like people hitting each other in turn). (\ref{exe:naukosalir}) is the description of a clip (no. 21) of four people sitting at a table, giving each other different items of food and drink. Each person gives and receives, but not necessarily to and from the same person. The verb kosalir `to exchange' retains its valency, but changes in meaning. In non-reciprocal constructions, its object is replaced with another version of itself (another set of clothes, a part of the house when renovating, fresh food on the table). In reciprocal constructions, the object changes owner but is not replaced.
A: word: nau=kosalir	 gloss: RECP=exchange

Sentence (with missing item): mu bir namabuk=teba ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL beer drunk={\glteba} ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`They're drunk on beer, fighting.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some verbs, when used in reciprocal constructions, take a more abstract meaning. The verbs tu `to hit' and sair `to shoot (with a gun)' are used for expressing fighting or even war. (\ref{exe:nausair}) is about the Second World War, and~(\ref{exe:nautu}) describes picture 4 from the Family problems picture task\is{picture-matching task} \parencite{carroll2009} with angry-looking people drinking beer. One person is touching another on the shoulder and another is raising his fist but they are not actually hitting each other. While nausair is only attested in war contexts, nautu can also simply mean `hit each other'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They are making up.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Other verbs that get a more abstract meaning when used reciprocally are tan nau=kinkin `hand \textsc{recp}=hold', which means `to shake hands', and the morpheme ___ `to make up', from bes `to be good'. The latter is illustrated in~(\ref{exe:naubes}), which describes people making up after a fight. The intransitive verb bes is transitivised with help of paruo `to make' (§\ref{sec:caus}), and then reduced in valency again with help of reciprocal nau=.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] hung everywhere.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nau= is in a few cases used in a \is{distributive}distributive sense. In~(\ref{exe:naunggang}), it is prefixed to gang `to hang' to talk about items hanging in a tree. It is distributive in the sense that the items hang in different places. In~(\ref{exe:us}), it is used to describe a naked man. That example is distributive in the sense that the man's penis is seen in movement, dangling from the body.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] move the betel plate above the canoe and circle her three times. After circling [her]...'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The applicatives the morpheme ___ `to circle somebody?' and ko=garung (/koŋgaruŋ/) `to talk about?' have only two occurrences each in the corpus, in which a patient and a theme are promoted to object, respectively. The only occurrences of the morpheme ___ are the ones in~(\ref{exe:konaurar}), from a story that describes a ritual\is{ritual} for the welcoming of a new spouse to Karas Island, whereby the spouse sits in a canoe while a plate with betel leaves is circled above her head. While in this example a person is circled, more data might show that the morpheme ___ takes any location as its object. Ko=garung `to talk about?' has one example (see \ref{exe:kadanat}) where the theme is the object argument. The other example, given in~(\ref{exe:lembaec}), from the same text, lacks an object. The understood object may be either the prison (the theme), mentioned in the clause before or the people the ex-prisoner is talking to (the goal), who are visible in the picture that is being described in this utterance.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Lastly, causative di= is employed in give-constructions (§\ref{sec:give}). It is not obligatory, and it remains unclear what guides the choice for using (example~\ref{exe:sungdi}) or omitting (example~\ref{exe:pitin}) \is{causative}causative di= in a give-construction, and whether it is a valency-increasing device in these constructions or not. In any case, the zero morpheme `give' may be used with the theme (the indirect object argument that is most commonly omitted from the construction) whether di= is used or not, as the two examples in~(\ref{exe:sungdi}) and~(\ref{exe:pitin}) illustrate.%also unclear if recipient is an argument or is predicate.

The English translation of this sentence is:`After finishing drilling the canoe, right, [we] put up one side.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In fact, in the give-constructions, as in many other constructions with causative di=, the proclitic seems to indicate movement towards an endpoint besides being a valency increaser. The use of di= seems to put the focus on the endpoint or the goal of a movement rather than on the movement itself. When used with directional verbs, di= indicates that the movement ends somewhere. In~(\ref{exe:disaran}), the endpoint is the edge of the canoe, on which a plank (the omitted object noun) is attached after drilling holes. In~(\ref{exe:kiesirii}), repeated from~(\ref{exe:kiesiri}) above, the terminus is the sea-side, and the object is two poles of wood. When used with directional verbs, di= can often be translated as `put'.

Gloss (with missing item): wood=OBJ 3PL CLF_LONG-two-OBJQNT ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Of wood, they moved two poles to the sea-side.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In fact, in the give-constructions, as in many other constructions with causative di=, the proclitic seems to indicate movement towards an endpoint besides being a valency increaser. The use of di= seems to put the focus on the endpoint or the goal of a movement rather than on the movement itself. When used with directional verbs, di= indicates that the movement ends somewhere. In~(\ref{exe:disaran}), the endpoint is the edge of the canoe, on which a plank (the omitted object noun) is attached after drilling holes. In~(\ref{exe:kiesirii}), repeated from~(\ref{exe:kiesiri}) above, the terminus is the sea-side, and the object is two poles of wood. When used with directional verbs, di= can often be translated as `put'.

Question 55:
You are a linguist specializing in Kalamang. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): an bo wat=at ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG go coconut=OBJ ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`I climbed the coconut.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Directional verbs may also be used with a subject and object argument without use of di=. In these cases, the verbs indicate ongoing movement, or have less focus on the goal of the movement and more on the movement itself. (\ref{exe:waratsara}) is about climbing a coconut palm in order to pick coconuts. The focus is on the entire harvesting action, which does not finish at the top of the tree. Also, directional verbs without causative di= take a subject that is the moving referent, and an object that is a location. Directional verbs with causative di=, on the other hand, take a subject that is the causer, and an object that is the moving referent. See Table~\ref{tab:disubob}.
A: word: sarat=et	 gloss: ascend=IRR
B: word: kosarat=et	 gloss: hit=IRR

Sentence (with missing item): mat ___ ye na=melelu ge
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.OBJ ___ or CAUS-sit no
The English translation of this sentence is:`Put him to sleep, wake him up, no.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Kalamang employs several other causative strategies. One is causative proclitic ma= (na= before verbs in m-), as in~(\ref{exe:namin}) and~(\ref{exe:masala}). Another strategy is to use a \is{predicate!complex}complex predicate with paruo `to do; to make' (example~\ref{exe:eiganpa}, see also §\ref{sec:svccaus}). Both strategies have 28 corpus occurrences, and neither is productive.
A: word: na=min	 gloss: CAUS-sleep
