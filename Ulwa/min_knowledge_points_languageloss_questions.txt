Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): iya nï imba p-e i ___
Gloss (with missing item): yes 1SG night be-DEP go.PFV ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Yes, I was going at night.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A very common form of this \isi{morphosyntactic} calquing from \ili{Tok Pisin} is the use of the \isi{locative verb} form the morpheme ___ ‘be.\textsc{pst}’ as an \isi{auxiliary verb} following the main verb to signal \isi{continuous}, \isi{progressive}, or \isi{habitual} \isi{aspect}. This may have been derived thanks to the very similar role of stap ‘be’ in \ili{Tok Pisin}. Not only does the Ulwa \isi{suffix} parallel the \ili{Tok Pisin} word in meaning (both are used in \isi{locative clause}s), but it also resembles the \ili{Tok Pisin} word \isi{phonological}ly (the two forms rhyme). In example \REF{ex:loss:1}, the \isi{perfective} form of the verb is used, but with the form the morpheme ___ ‘be.\textsc{pst’} following it to signal \isi{continuous} action in the past.

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): imba p-e ___
Gloss (with missing item): night be-DEP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[I] was going at night and …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the immediately following sentence, however, the speaker “corrects” to the more traditional means of expressing \isi{past} \isi{continuous} action, which is an \isi{imperfective} verb form \REF{ex:loss:2}.
A: word: ma-n-e	 gloss: go-IPFV-DEP

Sentence (with missing item): iya nï imba p-e ___ wap
Gloss (with missing item): yes 1SG night be-DEP ___ be.PST
The English translation of this sentence is:`Yes, I was going at night.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentences such as \REF{ex:loss:1} are thus lthe morpheme ___kely the morpheme ___nfluenced by structures the morpheme ___n \the morpheme ___lthe morpheme ___{Tok Pthe morpheme ___sthe morpheme ___n}.

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): iya nï imba p-e i ___
Gloss (with missing item): yes 1SG night be-DEP go.PFV ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Yes, I was going at night.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentences such as \REF{ex:loss:1} are thus likely influenced by structures in \ili{Tok Pisin}. To express \isi{continuous} action, \ili{Tok Pisin} employs the marker i stap (the \isi{predicate marker} i ‘\textsc{pred’} + stap ‘be’). Moreover, the chance similarity between the \ili{Tok Pisin} \isi{predicate marker} i ‘\textsc{pred’} and the Ulwa verb i ‘go.\textsc{pfv}’ has perhaps further influenced the adoption of this construction.
A: word: wap	 gloss: be.PST

Gloss (with missing item): [name] old SG.DIST 3SG.OBJ=take walk-IPFV ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`That old [man] Kapos used to carry it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:loss:3}, the morpheme ___ ‘be.\textsc{pst’} serves a \isi{habitual} function. Here it follows a verb that is already marked as \isi{imperfective}.
A: word: wap	 gloss: be.PST

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3PL=scrape-PFV 3PL=scrape-PFV machete take 3PL=cut-[put-]PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] scraped and scraped and scraped them, [and then] got machetes and cut them.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some speakers of Ulwa also make use of \isi{iconic} repetition of verbs to signal \isi{iterative} (or, occasionally, \isi{durative}) \isi{aspect}. This, too, seems influenced from \ili{Tok Pisin}, in which verbs may be repeated to signal \isi{iterative} action (although this could, of course, also reflect a general tendency in languages towards \isi{iconic} representation of iterated activity). Thus, repeated verbs may be used to signal repetitive \REF{ex:loss:4} or \isi{durative} \REF{ex:loss:5} action.

The \isi{predicate marker} i ‘\textsc{pred’} does appear elsewhere in Ulwa discourse, but, due to its \isi{homophony} with the \isi{suppletive} \isi{perfective} form of the verb ‘go’, it is often difficult to determine whether the form [i] is being used as the \isi{predicate marker} or as a \isi{calque} of \ili{Tok Pisin} go ‘go’, which is used to achieve similar grammatical functions.

Examples \REF{ex:loss:18}, \REF{ex:loss:19}, and \REF{ex:loss:20} illustrate the use of \ili{Tok Pisin} loan verbs without any \isi{suffix} or \isi{auxiliary verb}.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ u-nji wombïn ma=n ni-nda
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 2SG-POSS work 3SG.OBJ=OBL act-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`[I] will help you do your work.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Notably, one \ili{Tok Pisin} loan verb does seem to permit objects: this is the \ili{Tok Pisin} verb helpim ‘help’, which is generally pronounced [alpim] in Ulwa. As in some varieties of \ili{Tok Pisin}, Ulwa lacks the \isi{glottal} \isi{fricative} [h]. Ulwa furthermore forbids the \is{mid vowel} mid \isi{front vowel} [e] word-initially. In example \REF{ex:loss:21}, the 2\textsc{sg} \isi{object marker} is the \isi{direct object} of the verb.
A: word: u=alpim	 gloss: 2SG=help
B: word: ma=alpim	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=help
C: word: u=nap	 gloss: 2SG=for
D: word: kuma=n	 gloss: some=OBL

The English translation of this sentence is:`The children are helping him buy things.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentence \REF{ex:loss:28} illustrates the use of the verb alpim ‘help’ with the \isi{auxiliary verb} unda- ‘go around’.

Sentence (with missing item): nï ango tïki ankam ___ lukawtim=p-na
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG NEG again person ___ look.after=COP-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`I won’t look after other people anymore.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The loan verb lukawtim ‘look after’ is also exceptional in that it seems sometimes to take the \isi{copular enclitic} rather than using a \isi{periphrastic} construction with a verb of ‘going’ to convey \isi{TAM} meaning. This perhaps reflects the fact that this verb has been adopted into Ulwa as a non-verbal element (cf. kalam ‘knowledge’, \isi{borrow}ed from \ili{Waran}, \sectref{sec:5.4}). Still, like most loan verbs that come from \ili{Tok Pisin}, lukawtim ‘look after’ does not permit an object, but rather makes use of \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}s marked by =n ‘\textsc{obl}’, as in \REF{ex:loss:29}.
A: word: kuma=n	 gloss: some=OBL
