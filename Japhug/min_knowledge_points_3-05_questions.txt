Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex:iCqha.aforementioned}) illustrates the most typical use of this marker. Sentence (\ref{ex:kAtWm}) introduces a new referent, \japhug{the morpheme ___}{its gloss ___ of thread} marked with the indefinite determiner \forme{ci} (§\ref{sec:indef.article}). Three clauses later in (\ref{ex:iCqha.kAtWm}), the same referent occurs again as an overt noun with two topic markers, the postnominal nɯ and the prenominal iɕqʰa.
A: word: kɤtɯm	 gloss: ball
