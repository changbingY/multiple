Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Pag-tapos nay igma, ___ kay ta sini.
Gloss (with missing item): NR.ACT-finish 1p{excl.gen} lunch ___ 1p{excl.abs} NABS movie
The English translation of this sentence is:‘After finishing our lunch, we watched a movie.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is a difference between \isi{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} and grammatical transitivity. Semantic transitivity has to do with situations being communicated, whereas grammatical transitivity has to do with grammatical structures used to depict those situations. The two types of transitivity do not necessarily coincide. For example, English constructions such as she already ate, or he drank of the water of bitterness present semantically transitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} situations (someone eating or drinking something) in grammatically intransitive constructions (there is no direct object). Something similar occurs in Kagayanen. Situations that seem to require an Undergoer and a distinct Controller may be expressed in an intransitive construction, with the Undergoer simply omitted or presented in the non-absolutive case, preceded by ta or ki. We describe such constructions as detransitive\is{detransitive constructions}. Such constructions are used when there is an Undergoer, but it is less salient in the communicative situation than the Actor in some way. The Actor is presented as the most affected participant, and the Undergoer, if present at all, is presented as less central in some way, either by being indefinite, non-specific, incompletely affected, and so on. Of course, the big difference between English and Kagayanen is that English does not mark grammatical transitivity on the verb, whereas Kagayanen does. The verb eat is the same whether it occurs in a transitive (SUBJ eats OBJ) or intransitive (SUBJ eats) frame. In Kagayanen, however, the verb in a detransitive construction is explicitly marked as intransitive. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref118364790} and \REF{bkm:Ref125017724} illustrate detransitive constructions from the corpus. Additional examples are found throughout this grammar.

Gloss (with missing item): NR.ACT-finish 1p{excl.gen} lunch ___ 1p{excl.abs} NABS movie
The English translation of this sentence is:‘After finishing our lunch, we watched a movie.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref118364790} is part of a story about what the Actors did. It is not about any particular movie. In terms of \citealt{halliday2004}, sini, `movie', simply describes the ``range" over which the watching took place; the Actors engaged in ``movie watching". Therefore the Actor is presented as absolutive (kay `absolutive, first person plural exclusive'), and the verb is inflected as intransitive (ga- `intransitive, realis'). Similarly, example \REF{bkm:Ref125017724} is about the mothers, and not any particular lunar eclipse. In this case, the mothers are the Head of a modifying (relative) clause. As will be discussed in \chapref{chap:clausecombining}, the Head of a relative clause must be the absolutive of that clause. Therefore, the verb inside the relative clause must be in an intransitive form with the Actor understood as the absolutive.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1P.EXCL.ABS first/for.a.while NABS point-NR because I.R-PL-goggles INC PL crew NABS viand
The English translation of this sentence is:`We stopped off first at the point (of the island) because the crew were still spear fishing for viand.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The inflectional prefix ga{}- is the most common form for \isi{dynamic intransitive events} on the storyline in narratives. In this usage, the aspectual interpretation is perfective\is{perfective aspect}, as in the first clause of example \REF{bkm:Ref396718263}:

The English translation of this sentence is:`We stopped off first at the point (of the island) because the crew were still spear fishing for viand.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: However, predicates inflected with ga{}- may be understood as imperfective\is{imperfective aspect}. For example, the second occurrence of ga- (ganampara) in \REF{bkm:Ref396718263} is within an adverbial clause expressing a backgrounded, non-storyline event. The imperfective aspect interpretation is reenforced by the use of the incompletive adverbial pa.

The English translation of this sentence is:`When we arrived on the other side (of a river), we were/began walking again as before going to Teresa.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref396718461} illustrates one use of ga- in which the interpretation may be either \isi{inceptive} or imperfective. The event of walking is ongoing in the story. After the sentence illustrated in \REF{bkm:Ref396718461}, the story describes crossing a river on stepping stones and other events that happened on the way to the community of Teresa. Therefore, example \REF{bkm:Ref396718461} may be understood as a (perfective) inceptive “we began to walk again” or it could mean “we were walking again.” In either case it does not describe the entire event of walking to Teresa, and therefore is not perfective:
A: word: gapanaw	 gloss: I.R-go/walk

Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Ti ___ din en bata-an ya tak ambaļ ta manakem ya, “∅-akid-an no bata-an no.
Gloss (with missing item): so ___ 3S.ERG CM child-NR DEF.F because say NABS older DEF.F T.IR-serve.food-APL 2S.ERG child-NR 2S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:`So she served food to the children because the older woman said, “Serve food to your children.”'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Third, the minority class consists of two subclasses, Class VIa and Class VIIb. Class VIIa roots may or may not take an applicative suffix in a grammatically transitive frame, while Class VIIb roots always take an applicative suffix in a grammatically transitive frame. Semantically, Class VIIa consists mostly of verbs of transfer, for example the first bolded verb in \REF{bkm:Ref119939353}, while Class VIIb consists of verbs that always take an applicative suffix in their basic, transitive form (\ref{ex:yourthings} and \ref{ex:yourschooling}). They may occur without the applicative, but only in a grammatically intransitive frame (i.e., detransitive constructions, see example \ref{bkm:Ref447101267} further below, and \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:grammaticalrelations}). Semantically, Class VIIb verbs tend strongly to describe activities that involve superficial, incomplete, or invisible effect on the Patient.
A: word: pa-akid-an	 gloss: T.R-serve.food-APL
B: word: “∅-akid-an	 gloss: T.IR-serve.food-APL
C: word: mag-pa-ilis	 gloss: I.IR-CAUS-shallow.sea

Sentence (with missing item): Ti pa-akid-an din en bata-an ya tak ambaļ ta manakem ya, ___ no bata-an no.
Gloss (with missing item): so T.R-serve.food-APL 3S.ERG CM child-NR DEF.F because say NABS older DEF.F ___ 2S.ERG child-NR 2S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:`So she served food to the children because the older woman said, “Serve food to your children.”'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Third, the minority class consists of two subclasses, Class VIa and Class VIIb.

Question 20:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Ti ___ din en bata-an ya tak ambaļ ta manakem ya, “∅-akid-an no bata-an no.
Gloss (with missing item): so ___ 3S.ERG CM child-NR DEF.F because say NABS older DEF.F T.IR-serve.food-APL 2S.ERG child-NR 2S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:`So she served food to the children because the older woman said, “Serve food to your children.”'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As mentioned above, for Class VI roots, the applicative -an overrides -en/-on, thus leaving “zero” (a conspicuous absence of affixation) as the indicator of the transitive, irrealis inflection (see \chapref{chap:stemformingprocesses}, \sectref{sec:applicative-an} for further discussion). Thus the applicative suffix forms a stem that belongs to Class VII. This makes some semantic sense since the applicative indicates a superficially, invisibly or partially affected Undergoer (see \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:applicativevoice}), and most verbs in Class VII also involve less than fully affected Patients as Undergoers (see \tabref{tab:rootsthattaketwodistincttransitiveirrealisinflections-1} in \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}). Example \REF{bkm:Ref447101267} illustrates the Class VII root akid, ‘to serve food’, in the basic transitive form (realis modality), and in the irrealis detransitive form:
A: word: pa-akid-an	 gloss: T.R-serve.food-APL
B: word: “∅-akid-an	 gloss: T.IR-serve.food-APL
C: word: kalilawan	 gloss: Philippine.oriole

Sentence (with missing item): Ti pa-akid-an din en bata-an ya tak ambaļ ta manakem ya, ___ no bata-an no.
Gloss (with missing item): so T.R-serve.food-APL 3S.ERG CM child-NR DEF.F because say NABS older DEF.F ___ 2S.ERG child-NR 2S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:`So she served food to the children because the older woman said, “Serve food to your children.”'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As mentioned above, for Class VI roots, the applicative -an overrides -en/-on, thus leaving “zero” (a conspicuous absence of affixation) as the indicator of the transitive, irrealis inflection (see \chapref{chap:stemformingprocesses}, \sectref{sec:applicative-an} for further discussion).

Question 22:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ din arey din Lisga.\footnotemark{}
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG friend 3S.GEN fire.ant
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he remembered his friend Fire Ant.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note that -an itself cannot be the marker of the transitive, irrealis inflection because it also occurs in realis contexts (see \ref{bkm:Ref120012965} and many other examples thoughout this grammar). On the other hand, “zero” as a marker of transitive, irrealis inflection is independently attested for a large lexical class of roots (Class VII, see \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}, \tabref{tab:rootsthattaketwodistincttransitiveirrealisinflections-1}).
A: word: na-demdem-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-remember-APL
B: word: ma-demdem-an	 gloss: A.HAP.IR-remember-APL

The English translation of this sentence is:`I need to get some thorns and put (them) on the trunk of the banana plant so that you can’t come down.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All Class VII roots (mostly verbs of transfer) may occur with the i{}- with the same deontic meaning illustrated above. The following are some examples from the corpus. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref447005121} and \REF{bkm:Ref119941404} illustrate the verb batang ‘to put X somewhere’. In example \REF{bkm:Ref447005121} the same root occurs in the unmarked transitive irrealis form meaning ‘will place the liver (absolutive) of the chick on the diaphragm of the person who is sick’ and in \REF{bkm:Ref119941404} it occurs with the i{}- prefix meaning ‘I must put the thorns (absolutive) on the banana plant.’

The English translation of this sentence is:`I need to get some thorns and put (them) on the trunk of the banana plant so that you can’t come down.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The implication in \REF{bkm:Ref119941404} is that the speaker is compelled by the need to prevent the addressee from climbing down the banana plant.
A: word: ibatang	 gloss: T.DEON-put

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1S.ERG pestle DEF.N LK make 3S.ERG
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I will pound (something) with the pestle that s/he made.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref460145354} through \REF{bkm:Ref447269492} illustrate verbs that can occur with i- functioning in an applicative frame, in which case a deontic sense is possible, but not necessary. This function is not very productive, and only occurs with certain verbs that take -en as their basic, transitive irrealis form-mostly verbs that involve some special instrument. For example, the verb asod ‘to pound grain’ implies a specific instrument, aļļo ‘pestle’. For this and similar verbs, i- selects the instrument as the absolutive argument (instrumental voice-see \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:instrumentalvoice}), though with \textit{{}-en} and the other transitive affixes, this verb selects the theme as the absolutive:
A: word: i-asod	 gloss: T.DEON-pound

The English translation of this sentence is:`They happened to meet the son of their teacher whose name is Pedro who came from Puerto.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref396387524} the happenstantial na{}- expresses a realized dynamic event that just happened without anyone intentionally trying to make it happen. This sentence could also express a realized capability, ‘they were able to (intentionally) meet’, but the discourse context makes it clear that the intended meaning is happenstance. It is also not perfect aspect because it asserts the event rather than a state resulting from an earlier event:
A: word: na-sugat	 gloss: A.HAP.R-meet
B: word: ga-sugat-ay	 gloss: I.R-meet-REC

Sentence (with missing item): Pag-labyog ta pangka ta bula ya, ___ dayon ta princesa.
Gloss (with missing item): NR.ACT-throw NABS frog NABS ball DEF.F ___ immediately NABS princess
The English translation of this sentence is:`When the frog threw the ball (lit. the frog’s throwing of the ball), the princess immediately was able to catch it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In examples \REF{bkm:Ref396387548} and \REF{bkm:Ref119941722} na{}- expresses a realized capability: ‘was able to.’ In this case, happenstance is not likely since “catching the ball” and “carrying the child” are not situations that occur without intention. And again, they are not perfect in aspect since they assert events rather than resultant states:
A: word: na-saļap	 gloss: A.HAP.R-catch

Gloss (with missing item): butterfly DEF.M CTR if/when A.HAP.IR-see 1P.INCL.ERG too CM now/today long CM mouth 3S.GEN DEF.M because ___ NABS parrot.fish
The English translation of this sentence is:`The butterfly fish if we could see (it/them) indeed now/today, its mouth is long because the parrot fish has squeezed (it).’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref392922782} illustrates na- in a dynamic transitive construction expressing perfect aspect. Note that the Actor, the parrot fish, is marked as non-absolutive. This indicates that the absolutive argument is the Patient, the butterfly fish’s mouth. Happenstantial is used in this case to indicate a state that resulted from an event that happened earlier in the order of events on the storyline, and therefore may be understood as perfect in aspect:
A: word: na-kemes	 gloss: A.HAP.R-squeeze
B: word: na-kita	 gloss: A.HAP.R-see
C: word: na-kamang	 gloss: A.HAP.R-get
D: word: i-akid	 gloss: T.DEON.APL-serve.food

The English translation of this sentence is:`In previous times, if/when two-masted boats or launches would depart, (they) passed close by this island…’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If the first verb in the construct illustrated in \REF{bkm:Ref89078422} were marga, which consists of m{}- ‘dynamic, intransitive, irrealis’ plus the root larga, then the sentence would imply a more immediate event ‘(the launch) will purposely depart’. The verb form maglarga is the general irrealis form, open to multiple interpretations, or some more distant future event. The form malarga describes events that happened many times in the past. Irrealis modality is appropriate because no particular event is asserted.

For this reason, we say that naka{}- (and maka{}-) are “Actor-oriented”. Falling off the carabao in \REF{bkm:Ref447862443}, on the other hand, is “Undergoer-orien\-ted”---it is something that “happens to” the absolutive marked participant. However, in \REF{bkm:Ref447862310}, neither situation is on the storyline of the narrative. They are both “flashbacks” to earlier events that have relevance to the current narrative, but which do not themselves advance the storyline. For this reason a perfect aspect interpretation is appropriate. Furthermore, \REF{bkm:Ref447862310} contrasts with \REF{bkm:Ref448318853} through \REF{bkm:Ref392922782} in that these earlier examples are in transitive frames, whereas naka- always appears in an intransitive or detransitive frame in which the absolutive refers to the Controller.

In that case, the implication is that the fish accidentally bumped into a limestone formation after having swum off quickly without regard to the direction he was going. Then example \REF{bkm:Ref448309255} occurs at the end of the story with naka- indicating that the parrot fish had some responsibility for running into the rock because he had so mindlessly swum off.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ din sundang an.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG machete DEF.M
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he can break the machete.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If the prefix ma{}- were used here, it would be extremely awkward, and could only mean “\textsc{him} the machete broke,” since with ma{}- the absolutive has to be the Undergoer. To preserve the basic semantics using ma{}- the argument structure would need to change in order to make it clear that the machete is the Patient. Thus, the first part of \REF{bkm:Ref447962976} can be considered a detransitive counterpart of \REF{bkm:Ref447963964} (see \chapref{chap:voice} for a discussion of detransitive constructions):

Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ no imo na mga ginikanan.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 2S.ERG 2S.GEN LK PL parent
The English translation of this sentence is:‘You can help your parents.”
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb tabang, ‘to help’, is one that requires the applicative suffix in its basic transitive usage (see \chapref{chap:verbclasses-1}, \sectref{sec:volitionaltransitiveroots}). Since there is no applicative on tabang in \REF{bkm:Ref447963006}, it must be detransitive, and therefore is the counterpart of the transitive construction illustrated in \REF{bkm:Ref448035920}. Example \REF{bkm:Ref120014772} illustrates the same verb form in the text corpus:
A: word: ma-tabang-an	 gloss: HAP.IR-help-APL
B: word: ∅-tabang-an	 gloss: T.IR-help-APL
C: word: ∅-pangamuyo-an	 gloss: T.IR-pray-APL
D: word: na-daļa	 gloss: A.HAP.R-take/carry
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Gloss (with missing item): T.IR-pray-APL 1S.ERG 2S.ABS ony/just LK may.it.be ___ 2S.ABS TOO NABS work LK good
The English translation of this sentence is:`I will just pray for you that you may be able to find work that is good.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref392930212} and \REF{bkm:Ref120014811} illustrate maka{}- with the experiential verbs kita ‘to see/find’ and singngot ‘to smell s.t.’ With perception and cognition verbs, naka{}- and maka{}- are the normal detransitive (or “Actor voice”) forms that correspond to na{}-/ma{}- in a transitive frame:\footnote{For this reason, the ka component of naka{}- and maka{}- may be considered an explicit marker of an antipassive construction. However, we find scant independent evidence that this ka is a separate morpheme, for example, it is not used in any other modalities to express an antipassive (our detransitive) construction.}.
A: word: maka-kita	 gloss: I.HAP.IR-see
B: word: na-kita	 gloss: A.HAP.R-see
C: word: ma-kita	 gloss: A.HAP.IR-see

Gloss (with missing item): because if/when SPAT.DEF 1S.ABS pass NABS direction south(west) DEF.N ___ 3S.ABS NABS odor 1S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:`For, if I pass in the direction of south(west), he (a wild pig) will be able to smell my odor.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref392930212} and \REF{bkm:Ref120014811} illustrate maka{}- with the experiential verbs kita ‘to see/find’ and singngot ‘to smell s.t.’ With perception and cognition verbs, naka{}- and maka{}- are the normal detransitive (or “Actor voice”) forms that correspond to na{}-/ma{}- in a transitive frame:\footnote{For this reason, the ka component of naka{}- and maka{}- may be considered an explicit marker of an antipassive construction.

Gloss (with missing item): NEG.R 1S.ABS time LK ___ SPAT.DEF {obl.p} 2s
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I have no time that I can go down to you.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref447964968} through \REF{bkm:Ref120014968} illustrate maka{}- with semantically intransitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} volitional verb stems. These cannot be considered detransitives, because there is no Undergoer, and no transitive counterpart in which the Actor is ergative. They are semantically intransitive\is{semantic transitivity}\is{transitivity!semantic} concepts in which the only participant is an Actor, rather than an Undergoer. The dynamic irrealis affixes for these verbs are m{}- or mag{}- as in megbeng/magtegeng, miling/mag-iling, and magbakasyon. In these examples the happenstantial maka{}- expresses potential ability:
A: word: maka-tegbeng	 gloss: I.HAP.IR-go.down
B: word: maka-balik	 gloss: I.HAP.IR-return
C: word: m-panaog	 gloss: I.V.IR-go.down

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The prefix ka- also has an inferential\is{inferential} usage. In the context of example \REF{bkm:Ref447986985}, a fish sees a ship coming and tells all the other fish to hide. After the fish have hidden, example \REF{bkm:Ref447986985} occurs, expressing the inference that the boat most likely has passed by. In the sentence after that, the fish all look up and see that the boat in fact is moving away fast. An enablement interpretation of \REF{bkm:Ref447986985} is excluded by native speakers. In this context, the speaker (the fish) infers that the situation expressed by the root is true because of the external fact that much time has passed.
A: word: ka-lambay	 gloss: I.HAP-pass.by

Sentence (with missing item): Indi no imo ___ mga blawan an Pedro?
Gloss (with missing item): where 2S.ERG EMPH ___ PL gold DEF.M Pedro
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Where did you get the gold, Pedro!?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is clear that this omission of prefixes is “optional” for two reasons. First, such omission never results in ambiguity—speakers are always able to supply the missing form based on contextual factors. Second, sometimes inflectional prefixes do appear in these contexts, with no apparent variation in meaning. A full discourse study may be needed to determine whether there is a consistent pattern as to when prefixes are omitted versus when they are retained. Since most of the examples in this grammar are from natural texts, many have omitted prefixes. We have not edited or flagged these in any way, unless the omission is important to the point being illustrated in the example. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref119307770} and \REF{bkm:Ref119307774} illustrate affix omission, with the ellipsis character (…) in place of the omitted affix:
A: word: …-kamang-a	 gloss: T.R-get-XC
B: word: kamang-en	 gloss: get-T.IR
C: word: pa-dawat-a	 gloss: T.R-hand.to-XC

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The following examples illustrate the root, dala, ‘take/carry’, both with \REF{bkm:Ref394992438} and without \REF{bkm:Ref394992440} the overt transitive realis prefix. The argument structure frame (Actor-ergative and Undergoer-absolutive) makes it clear that both examples are transitive, and the contexts make it clear that both are realis:
