Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nouns can be defined by their distribution. Only nouns (or \isi{pronoun}s) can serve as subjects or objects of verbs. In practical terms, this means that the first word in a basic \isi{indicative} sentence with overtly expressed arguments will be either a noun or a \isi{pronoun}, since the unmarked SOV \isi{word order} demands a sentence-initial subject and only nouns and \isi{pronoun}s can serve that role.\footnote{However, see \sectref{sec:11.1} on argument omission; \sectref{sec:5.3} on the nominal uses of \isi{adjective}s; and \sectref{sec:8.2} on \isi{adverb}s, whose freer \isi{word order} allows sentence-initial placement.} In examples \REF{ex:nouns:5} and \REF{ex:nouns:6}, both \isi{intransitive} clauses, the noun is the first element in the sentence.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I am a walker.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nouns can be derived from verbs to denote the \isi{agent} of the action indicated by the verb. An \isi{agent noun} (\isi{nomen agentis}) bares the derivational \isi{suffix} \nobreakdash-en ‘\textsc{nmlz}’.\footnote{This \isi{suffix} may perhaps be further analyzable as consisting of the \isi{polysemous} \isi{suffix} /-e/, which can either mark \isi{imperfective} \isi{aspect} (\sectref{sec:4.4}) or signal that a clause is \isi{dependent} (\sectref{sec:12.2.1}), followed by a derivational \isi{suffix} /-n/, which could itself be related to the \isi{oblique marker} of the same form (\sectref{sec:11.4}).} The nominalizing \isi{morphology} in most instances affixes to the end of the \isi{verb stem}, as in \REF{ex:nouns:16}, which may be compared to a sentence illustrating a conjugated form of the same verb \REF{ex:nouns:17}.

In \REF{ex:nouns:18} this form receives the \isi{singular} \isi{subject marker} mï ‘\textsc{3sg.subj}’, whereas in \REF{ex:nouns:19} it receives the \isi{plural} \isi{subject marker} ndï ‘\textsc{3pl}’.
