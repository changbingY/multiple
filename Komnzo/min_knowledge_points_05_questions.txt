The English translation of this sentence is:`In our way of life ... in our living ... we walk about with fear because of this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The above examples show that \isi{valency alternations} are achieved by using the same verb in different templates. It is important to note that all the inflected verb forms share the same \isi{infinitive}, which is formed by suffixing the \isi{nominaliser} -si to the stem. In (\ref{ex324}) and (\ref{ex325}) I show the \isi{infinitive} with a \isi{stative} and a dynamic interpretation. Example (\ref{ex324}) is the conclusion of a short narrative about taboos and customs that involve the bird of paradise. The speaker uses msaksi with a \isi{locative} \isi{case} suffix in a \isi{possessive} construction to express `in our life'. In example (\ref{ex325}), the speaker showed me a beautiful place on the bank of the Morehead river. She comments that this is a good place to sit down and rest. Hence, the \isi{infinitive} msaksi is used for both interpretations, a timeless state in (\ref{ex324}) and a dynamic event in (\ref{ex325}).

Gloss (with missing item): then ___ EMPH kava TSG.MASC.ALPH-VC.-pour.EXT-NDU-STNSG. Recog.PURP EMPH TSG.POSS anger extinguish-NMLZ=PURP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`So they sit him down properly and pour kava for him to cool down his anger.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are two ways of analyzing shared infinitives in Komnzo, and I argue that both are needed. On the one hand, we can understand it as a system where \isi{valency} is fluid and lexemes are flexible. Under this analysis a lexeme can alter its \isi{valency} by occuring in different templates. On the other hand, we could adopt the notion of \isi{heterosemy} (\citealt{Lichtenberk:1991ic} and \citealt[524]{Evans:2012we}) to capture that different lexical items and meanings are expressed by different templates.\footnote{This assumes a definition of the linguistic sign as having three parts: form, meaning and combinatorics (or syntax) as put forward by Mel'{\v c}uk (\citeyear{Melcuk:1973vu}) and Pollard & Sag (\citeyear[51]{Pollard:1987wu}).} A verb like msaksi shows that we need both perspectives. On the one hand, msaksi\textsubscript{1} means `dwell, live' in a prefixing template, while msaksi\textsubscript{2} means `sit down' in a middle/ambifixing template. We would understand msaksi\textsubscript{1} as being heterosemous to msaksi\textsubscript{2} because there is a significant shift in meaning due to the template. The same holds for pairs like rfiksi meaning `grow' or `nuture' and rbänzsi meaning `untie' or `explain'. On the other hand, the system of \isi{valency alternations} in Komnze is very productive. Especially the \isi{middle} template and the \isi{ditransitive} ambifixing template can be used for almost every verb which can also occur in the \isi{transitive} ambifixing template. Thus, describing the alternation between msaksi in (\ref{ex322}) `sit someone down' and (\ref{ex323}) `sit someone's (child) down' in terms of \isi{heterosemy} would fall short of an exhaustive description. It would not adequately capture the productivity of the system, nor would it fully explain shared \isi{infinitive}s for verb forms of different templates.

The English translation of this sentence is:`What are these (of his) inside? These ones here!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All prefixing verbs can take the \isi{valency change} prefix a-. This template was labelled \isi{indirect object} prefixing in \tabref{argalignverbs}. However, in doing so they remain monovalent in their cross-referencing. The `additional argument', usually a beneficiary or possessor, replaces the `original argument', usually an experiencer. However, the event itself ``is still about'' the original argument. A common usage of this pattern involves the \isi{copula}: When handing something to a person, one would say bnarä! `There you are!' (lit. `(It) is there for you!'). A textual example comes from a stimulus task in which two speakers are describing the contents of picture cards (\ref{ex160}). The picture in the example shows a policeman handing some personal belongings to another man. After describing the scene, one of the two speakers points to a few things on the side, asking what these were. The first verb in (\ref{ex160}) `be lying down' indexes the (assumed) \isi{possessor} and not the things on the ground. The second clause is accompanied by a pointing gesture in order to draw the interlocutor's attention to the objects. Here, the copula indexes the things on the ground.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like most \isi{positional} verbs, migsi can enter into other templates, for example a \isi{middle} template (`assume a hanging position') or a \isi{transitive} template (`hang something'). This is shown in examples (\ref{ex326}) and (\ref{ex327}) respectively. Example (\ref{ex326}) is part of a plant walk around Rouku village. The speaker shows me a plant in the part of the land which is inundated during the rainy season. Example (\ref{ex327}) comes from a procedural text in which the speaker shows me around his yam storage house.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Those two catfish are hanging there. I just brought them here on my shoulder with the carrying stick.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Just like other verbs in the prefixing template, positionals may add a \isi{possessor} or \isi{beneficiary} by using the \isi{valency change} prefix a-. An example of this is given in (\ref{ex158}) where the speaker describes how he carried two fish up from the river. The first verb in (\ref{ex158}) indexes the two catfish, but the second verb indexes a first singular, in this case the \isi{possessor} (`on top of my shoulder'). Thus, although the predicate is about the two fish (`They were on top.'), the verb only indexes the first singular.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Just like other verbs in the prefixing template, positionals may add a \isi{possessor} or \isi{beneficiary} by using the \isi{valency change} prefix a-. An example of this is given in (\ref{ex158}) where the speaker describes how he carried two fish up from the river. The first verb in (\ref{ex158}) indexes the two catfish, but the second verb indexes a first singular, in this case the \isi{possessor} (`on top of my shoulder'). Thus, although the predicate is about the two fish (`They were on top.'), the verb only indexes the first singular.

An example with a much clearer \isi{passive} reading is provided in (\ref{ex168}), where the speaker talks about sorting and selecting yam tubers in his storage house. The context reveals that it is the \isi{patient} argument of the verbs (`choose', `put down') which is indexed in the suffix. Keenan and Dryer include the entailment of an agent in their definition of passives setting them apart from middles (\citeyear[352]{Keenan:2007passives}). In Komnzo, this is dependent on the semantics of the verb. Prototypical \isi{transitive} verbs, like `choose' and `put down' in (\ref{ex168}), invite a \isi{passive} interpretation rather than an \isi{impersonal} one. However, in terms of morpho-syntax, there is no dedicated \isi{passive} marking. Furthermore, the agent noun phrase cannot be included in the clause, because it would have to be indexed in the suffix of the verb, which is already occupied by the \isi{patient} argument.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We have seen an \isi{impersonal} usage of the \isi{middle} template in (\ref{ex329}). An example with a much clearer \isi{passive} reading is provided in (\ref{ex168}), where the speaker talks about sorting and selecting yam tubers in his storage house. The context reveals that it is the \isi{patient} argument of the verbs (`choose', `put down') which is indexed in the suffix. Keenan and Dryer include the entailment of an agent in their definition of passives setting them apart from middles (\citeyear[352]{Keenan:2007passives}). In Komnzo, this is dependent on the semantics of the verb. Prototypical \isi{transitive} verbs, like `choose' and `put down' in (\ref{ex168}), invite a \isi{passive} interpretation rather than an \isi{impersonal} one. However, in terms of morpho-syntax, there is no dedicated \isi{passive} marking. Furthermore, the agent noun phrase cannot be included in the clause, because it would have to be indexed in the suffix of the verb, which is already occupied by the \isi{patient} argument.

Question 28:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): naf ___ drdr mäyog-si=r.
Gloss (with missing item): TSG.ERG ___ old.garden repeat-NMLZ=PURP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`She suggested/said to continue the old garden.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A somewhat different function of the \isi{middle} template is the \isi{suppressed-object} \isi{middle}. The formal difference with respect to the previous functions of the \isi{middle} template lies in the marking of the NP, which receives \isi{ergative} marking. Thus, the argument is an actor and the event is inherently \isi{transitive}. Consider example (\ref{ex165}), which is taken from a conversation between two young men. The speaker reports to his friend what his wife thinks about his plan to shift the garden place to another location. In (\ref{ex165}), the \isi{pronoun} naf is in the \isi{ergative} \isi{case} and agrees with the verb ŋanafr which is in the \isi{middle} template. The \isi{object} is suppressed from indexation and without context we are left to speculate what it might be: the \isi{goal} (`she said to me') or the clausal \isi{theme} (`to continue the old garden').

The English translation of this sentence is:`She suggested/said to continue the old garden.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{suppressed-object} \isi{middle} is obligatory for a few lexemes, for example na- `speak (v.t.)' in (\ref{ex165}), karksi `pull (v.t.)' or yonasi\footnote{Interestingly, `drink' and `eat' share the same extended stem (na), but `eat' almost always occurs in an ambifixing transitive template and it employs a common noun as its infinitive (dagon `food'). The verb `drink' on the other hand employs the infinitive yonasi with a regular nominaliser suffix and it always occurs in a (suppressed-object) middle template. The restricted stems of `drink' and `eat' are different: nob and wob respectively.} `drink (v.t.)'. For most verbs, the \isi{suppressed-object} \isi{middle} is a possible alternation and should be seen as derived from verbs which normally employ an ambifixing \isi{transitive} template.

Sentence (with missing item): be nima yam ___ nzenme emoth be nima w-a-fiyok-w-r-∅.

The English translation of this sentence is:``You are behaving like this. You are doing this to our sister.''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another motivation for suppressing the \isi{object}, partly relevant to the previous example, lies in the relative salience of the referent. There is a tendency for \isi{inanimate} referents not to be indexed, as we can see in example (\ref{ex166}). This example is taken from a stimulus task about domestic violence. The speaker takes over the role of one of the characters in the story. He uses the verb fiyoksi `make' twice, first in a \isi{middle} template and then in a \isi{transitive} template.\footnote{As we will see in {\S}\ref{ambifixingtemp}, some transitive verbs like fiyoksi obligatorily take the valency change prefix a-. Since the argument is in absolutive case, one would expect the inflected verb to be wfiyokwr (without the a- prefix). But this is ungrammatical and fiyoksi never occurs without the a- prefix. Thus, I regard fiyoksi and similar verbs as being deponent.} The crucial difference between the two situation types lies in the salience of the referent. In the first clause the referent is generic and \isi{inanimate} (yam `custom, event'), but in the second clause it is a close relative (nzenme emoth `our sister').

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We can conclude that intrinsic middles are \isi{intransitive} event types, but the \isi{middle} template is used for various functions. The uniting characteristic of these functions is a relatively low degree of elaboration. This may apply either to the participants (\ref{ex166}), i.e. they rank low in importance/salience, or to the event itself (\ref{ex167}), i.e. the event is less elaborated.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The ambifixing template employs both affixes to index referents. The \isi{subject} argument appears in the suffix, while the \isi{object} argument is indexed in the prefix (\ref{ex170}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since no more than two referents can be indexed on a \isi{verb}, the same ambifixing template encodes \isi{transitive} and \isi{ditransitive} events. The differences lie in the presence versus absence of the \isi{valency change} prefix a- and the \isi{case} marking of that argument NP which is indexed in the prefix. In ambifixing transitives, the prefix encodes a patient (`prepare' in \ref{ex169}), theme (\ref{ex170}) or experiencer (`hold' in \ref{ex169}), all in the \isi{absolutive}. The prefix in ambifixing ditransitives encodes a goal (\ref{ex173}) in \isi{dative} \isi{case} or a possessor (\ref{ex171}) marked with a \isi{possessive}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex172}) highlights a problem that occurs with \isi{verb} forms using the restricted stem. As I have shown in {\S}\ref{dualextrs}, with restricted stems the dual versus non-dual contrast and the \isi{valency change} is expressed by a vowel change in the prefix. Although there are differences in the vowel pattern for different \isi{number} combinations, which show the absence versus presence of the \isi{valency change} prefix, there are a number of neutralisations ({\S}\ref{prerootdual}). The first verb sabrim in example (\ref{ex172}) can mean both `return him' (with a direct \isi{object}) or `return X for him' / `return his X' (with an \isi{indirect object}).

The English translation of this sentence is:``You are behaving like this. You are doing this to our sister.''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{valency change} prefix a- attaches productively to almost all \isi{transitive} verbs introducing a third argument into the clause, usually a \isi{beneficiary} (\isi{dative}) or \isi{possessor} (\isi{possessive}). A number of lexemes are \isi{deponent} in the sense that they obligatorily take the \isi{valency change} prefix a-, while the clause remains \isi{transitive} and the referent indexed in the prefix is flagged with the \isi{absolutive} \isi{case}. Such \isi{deponent} verbs are frmnzsi `prepare' (\ref{ex169}) or fiyoksi `make' (\ref{ex166}). Given the basic productivity of the \isi{ditransitive} alternation, we may ask whether the category `\isi{ditransitive}' exists in Komnzo at all or whether it is better to view the phenomenon merely as applicativisation, in other words whether all ditransitives are derived.\footnote{Please note that the a- prefix cannot be called an applicative prefix because it fulfils both functions: increasing and decreasing the valency. Thus, I prefer to label it valency change or valency switch.} Two counterarguments can be brought forward. First, there are a few verbs which only exist in an ambifixing \isi{ditransitive} template, the obvious one being yarisi `give'. Secondly, while the \isi{ditransitive} alternation simply introduces a \isi{beneficiary} for some verbs, there are rather idiosyncratic changes in meaning for other verbs. For example, säminzsi means `whisper' in the ambifixing \isi{transitive} template, but `teach' in the ambifixing \isi{ditransitive} template. Another example was given in (\ref{ex151}) where rbänzsi means `untie' as a \isi{transitive}, but `explain' in a \isi{ditransitive} template. Although the meanings of the different templates share the same \isi{infinitive}/\isi{nominalisation} and are clearly related (`untie' \rightarrow `untie for sb.' = `explain'), they often differ in idiosyncratic ways (`whisper' \rightarrow `whisper for sb.' = `teach'). Thus, it is better to recognise \isi{ditransitive} verbs as an independent category.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Komnzo imperatives can be imperfective (`Keep on doing X!') or \isi{perfective} (`Do X!'). An example of this is shown in (\ref{ex766}). This distinction is signalled by the stem type, but also by the fact that the second singular suffix in perfective imperatives is \isi{zero}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They will also yell at one another like this ``You stand properly in the clearing! Keep on standing!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \tabref{perssuffimp}, the middle verb -kwi `run' is shown. The distinction between second \isi{singular} and \isi{non-singular} is expressed by the suffix. Another quirk in the system is that the suffix -é is used even if the verb is a prefixing verb, despite the fact that the \isi{number} distinction is shown in the prefixes only: gn- \Ssg{} vs. th- \Snsg{} (\S\ref{personprefsection}). A prefixing verb like -kogr `stand' will be gnkogré `You (\Sg) keep standing!' versus thkogré `You (\Pl) keep standing!' In these cases I \isi{gloss} -é as marking solely \isi{imperative} mood, as in (\ref{ex766}). However, prefixing verbs do follow the pattern in that only extended stems (imperfective \isi{imperative}) receive the -é suffix, not the restricted stems (\isi{perfective} imperatives). I show this in example (\ref{ex766}), in which the speaker reports about the rough ways of going hunting with the \ili{Suki} people.\footnote{The verb kuk-/kog- `stand' is irregular in that it encodes dual versus non-dual in the positional stem, -kogr {\Ndu} vs. -kogrn {\Du}, but not in the restricted stem -kuk.} See also \S\ref{imperativesuffix} for further discussion of \isi{imperative} marking.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note that just like in post-stem \isi{dual} marking ({\S}\ref{ambiguitiesdualref}), pre-stem \isi{dual} marking is ambiguous as to which of the two arguments is \isi{dual} or \isi{non-dual}. The verb nzrakorth `they said to us' in (\ref{ex247}) could be any of the three possible actor>\isi{undergoer} combinations (\Pl>\Du, \Du>{\Du} or \Du>\Pl) because both \isi{person} affixes index a \isi{non-singular} \isi{participant}. Thus, the absence of the ä vowel indicates that one of the two participants is \isi{dual}, but not which one. Only context may solve this structural ambiguity, which in (\ref{ex247}) is clear from the second verb ŋakwinth `you two go'. For verbs in a prefixing template, there is no ambiguity since they index only one argument. Non-\isi{dual} participants receive the ä vowel, while \isi{dual} participants do not.

Compare (\ref{ex251}) with (\ref{ex252}) where the same verb yarisi `give' shows the ä because the actor \isi{participant} is \isi{plural}.

Question 54:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): katan kwa ___ kafar minzü \stem{yé}.
Gloss (with missing item): small FUT ___ big very TSG.MASC.COP.NDU.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I will make it smaller. It is very big.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We can conclude from the examples that the \isi{irrealis} inflection complies with the \isi{number} marking patterns as they were shown in Figure \ref{raezeroraevalchange}. The only difference lies in the fact that the \isi{irrealis} prefix ra- creates neutralisations in more combinations (with regard to the \isi{valency change}) because ra- contains a vowel. However, there is one important caveat to this conclusion. As I have pointed out in {\S}\ref{prefixingverbsec} and {\S}\ref{ambifixingtemp}, there are some verbs which are \isi{deponent} in the sense that they obligatorily take the a- without a change in \isi{valency}. Two examples are the \isi{transitive} verb fiyoksi `make' and the intransitive/prefixing verb yarenzsi `look'. Consequently we would expect them to comply with the pattern in Figure \ref{raezeroraevalchange}. Consider example (\ref{ex254}) with a \Sg>{\Sg} \isi{participant} combination and example (\ref{ex255}) with its single referent in {\Sg}. Both show the \isi{non-dual} vowel ä, i.e. they violate the pattern in Figure \ref{raezeroraevalchange}, which predicts the vowel to be a and not ä. This violation occurs only with \isi{deponent} verbs and only in \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}. The natural explanation is that, for \isi{deponent} verbs, the distinction between the presence vs. absence of the \isi{valency change} prefix is redundant.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He stands there with his walking stick and he is just looking from there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{directional} affixes can be used with dynamic events (\ref{ex262}) or with stative verbs (\ref{ex260}) The latter is taken from the description of a picture card, and the image depicts an older man, who is standing in the background watching what is happening. The \isi{venitive} inflection on `stand' refers to the direction of his posture, i.e. he is standing facing towards the \isi{deictic} centre.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Our ancestors where tying the bowstring this way. We have been following (this custom) until today.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The spatial semantics of the \isi{directional} inflection can be extended to cover metaphorical uses. Example (\ref{ex261}) shows a \isi{temporal} use where the speaker explains the old custom of tying a bowstring. Thus, he literally says that he `follows the custom hither'. Example (\ref{ex263}) is a description of a very old woman, who has outlived some of her own children. The speaker uses the \isi{andative} inflection on the verb yathizsi `die' which is best translated into \ili{English} as `pass away'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`His exchange man heard him (and said:) ``Oh, there is a man calling out for the canoe.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Clitic demonstratives are always used situationally in order to point, direct or show the location of an event or a referent in relation to the \isi{deictic} center. Example (\ref{ex265})\footnote{The verb -nor `shout' is deponent and takes the valency change prefix a- prefix without an impact on the argument structure.} comes from a narrative. The \isi{deictic} center of that part of the story is a man who is sitting in his camp and happens to hear someone shouting from the river. Note that both verbs (`hear' and `shout') are inflected with a \isi{venitive} marker. Thus, we can translate the second verb byannor, to which the \isi{medial} clitic \isi{demonstrative} (b= \Med) is attached, as `He shouts there towards here'.

Example (\ref{ex272}) is taken from a plant walk, where the speaker points out two different kinds of trees: mni the morpheme ___wzö and fothr (sometimes called fothr the morpheme ___wzö).\footnote{The words the morpheme ___wzö and fothr are proper nouns. However, mni means `fire' and the name mni the morpheme ___wzö `fire the morpheme ___wzö' is used because the bark of this tree is hardened over the fire and later used for house walls.} In the recording, fothr the morpheme ___wzö trees stood between the speaker and some mni the morpheme ___wzö trees. Hence, the latter are marked as being further away and all \isi{deictic} markers are \isi{medial}: the \isi{deictic} (the morpheme ___ `there'), the \isi{proclitic} on the verb (bikogro `it stands there') and the \isi{deictic} in \isi{ablative} \isi{case} (bobafa `from there').

Question 68:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): bä ane mni bäwzö b=y-kogr-o ___ \stem{yé} z=\stem{yé} fothr zba=fa boba=fa mni bäwzö.
Gloss (with missing item): MED DEM fire bäwzö MED=TSG.MASC.ALPH-stand.NDU-ANDAT ___ TSG.MASC.COP.NDU PROX=TSG.MASC.COP.NDU fothr PROX.ABL=ABL MED.ABL=ABL fire bäwzö.
The English translation of this sentence is:`There, mni bäwzö is standing there. From here it is fothr bäwzö and from there (it is) mni bäwzö.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Naturally, \isi{deictic} markers are found mostly in situations where visual identification is important. Example (\ref{ex272}) is taken from a plant walk, where the speaker points out two different kinds of trees: mni bäwzö and fothr (sometimes called fothr bäwzö).\footnote{The words bäwzö and fothr are proper nouns. However, mni means `fire' and the name mni bäwzö `fire bäwzö' is used because the bark of this tree is hardened over the fire and later used for house walls.} In the recording, fothr bäwzö trees stood between the speaker and some mni bäwzö trees. Hence, the latter are marked as being further away and all \isi{deictic} markers are \isi{medial}: the \isi{deictic} (bä `there'), the \isi{proclitic} on the verb (bikogro `it stands there') and the \isi{deictic} in \isi{ablative} \isi{case} (bobafa `from there'). Note that the verb is also inflected with an \isi{andative} suffix because more trees of the mni bäwzö kind were growing in that direction. As for the other tree, fothr bäwzö, it is marked by a \isi{proximal} \isi{deictic} (the morpheme ___ `here'), a \isi{proximal} \isi{demonstrative} \isi{identifier} (zyé `it is here') and another \isi{proximal} \isi{deictic} in the \isi{ablative} \isi{case} (zbafa `from here').\footnote{Both deictics bobafa and zbafa are doubly ablative, i.e. boba is already ablative and contrasts with allative bobo. This is the only example in the corpus of doubly marked deictics.}

Question 71:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ane bä ___ büdisn=en mnz zn=en.
Gloss (with missing item): DEM MED ___ büdisn=LOC house place=LOC.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Those (dogs) were barking there in Büdisn at the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The three proclitics z=, b= and f= can in principle attach to verb forms of all TAM categories. For example, in (\ref{ex267}) the \isi{medial} b= is cliticised to a verb in the \isi{past} durative. Nevertheless, they occur most frequently with verbs in the present \isi{tense} because of their situational use.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ni w-mäg-n-e zöbthé.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ FNSG TSG.F.ALPH-lead.EXT-DU-FNSG first.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Where are they? We will lead (the path) first.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{clitic} m= only occurs with the \isi{copula} and the meaning `where is X?', as in (\ref{ex271}). As I will discuss in {\S}\ref{tam-particles-sec}, m= can attach to verbs in the \isi{irrealis} or \isi{imperative} \isi{mood}s with an \isi{apprehensive} (`you might do X!') and \isi{prohibitve} interpretation (`you must not do X!'), respectively. Formally, the m= \isi{clitic} patterns with the other demonstratives (See \tabref{demonstratives-table} in {\S}\ref{demonstratives-sec}).
A: word: m=e-rn	 gloss: where=STNSG.ALPH-COP.DU
