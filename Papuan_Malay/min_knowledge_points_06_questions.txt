Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Papuan Malay pronouns often co-occur with nouns or \isi{noun} phrases, as shown in (\ref{Example_6.1}). This chapter argues that ``\textsc{pro} \textsc{np}'' constructions in which a \isi{pronoun} precedes a \isi{noun} or \isi{noun} phrase, as in \textitbf{the morpheme ___ }[\textitbf{sungay the morpheme ___}] ‘you, [you river]’, constitute appositional constructions, with the pronouns having pronominal function. ``\textsc{np} \textsc{pro}'' constructions in which the \isi{pronoun} follows a \isi{noun} or \isi{noun} phrase, as in \textitbf{sungay the morpheme ___} ‘you river’, by contrast, are analyzed as \isi{noun} phrases with adnominally used pronouns in post-head position. To demonstrate this distinction, appositional \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} constructions and adnominal \textsc{np} \textsc{pro} constructions are discussed in some detail in §\ref{Para_6.1.6} and §\ref{Para_6.2}, respectively.

The conjunct that designates the entire set is encoded by a plural \isi{pronoun}. This conjunct is inclusory in that it “identifies a set of participants that includes the one or those referred to by the lexical \isi{noun} phrase”, as \citet[1]{Lichtenberk.2000} points out.

In Papuan Malay, both conjuncts are linked by means of overt coordination with the \isi{comitative} marker \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’, with its short form \textitbf{deng}.

You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): bapa dorang ___ pulang hari minggu cepat
Gloss (with missing item): father 3PL ___ go.home day Sunday be.fast
The English translation of this sentence is:‘father and he returned home quickly on Sunday’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions presented in (\ref{Example_6.26}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}) contrast with what \citet[33]{Haspelmath.2007c} calls “\isi{comitative} \isi{conjunction} constructions”, which denote additive relations. In Papuan Malay, such \isi{comitative} constructions are formed with \isi{comitative} \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’. The inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions in (\ref{Example_6.26}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}) also contrast with ``\textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl}'' \isi{noun} phrases with an \isi{associative} inclusory reading. Both contrasts are illustrated with the examples in (\ref{Example_6.32}) and (\ref{Example_6.33}).

Gloss (with missing item): ... ___ two with father D.DIST love 3SG
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[but this child] I and (my) husband (emph) love her’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As for the distinction of \isi{comitative} and inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions, \citet[33]{Haspelmath.2007c} makes the following cross-linguistic observations. In a \isi{comitative} \isi{conjunction} construction, the \isi{conjunction} of “two set-denoting \textsc{np}s [{\ldots}] ‘\{A, B\} and \{C, D\}’ yields the set \{A, B, C, D\}” (\citeyear*[33]{Haspelmath.2007c}). In inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions, by contrast, “some members of the second conjunct set are already included in the first conjunct set”; hence the result of the coordination is not the “union, but the \textitbf{unification} of the sets [such that] ‘\{A, B, C\} and \{B\}’ yields the set \{A, B, C\}” (\citeyear*[33]{Haspelmath.2007c}). This distinction also applies to Papuan Malay. While the constructions in (\ref{Example_6.26}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}) receive an inclusory reading, the \isi{comitative} ‘N1 \textitbf{dengang} ‘with’ \textsc{N2}’ \isi{conjunction} construction in (\ref{Example_6.32}) receives an additive reading.

The pragmatic differences between the constituent order found in (\ref{Example_6.26}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}) as compared to that found in (\ref{Example_6.33}) are similar to the differences found in \ili{Toqabaqit}, another \ili{Austronesian} language, as observed by \citet[27]{Lichtenberk.2000}: the contrast concerns “the relative degrees of discourse salience of the two sets of participants, the overtly and the covertly encoded ones”. This contrast also applies to Pathe morpheme ___an Malay. In (\ref{Example_6.28}) to (\ref{Example_6.29}), the covertly encoded participants subsumed under the adnominal dual constructions are more salient and therefore mentioned first.

Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ... tida perna dia liat, ___ sungay ko bisa terbuka begini
Gloss (with missing item): ... NEG once 3SG see ___ river 2SG be.able be.opened like.this
The English translation of this sentence is:[Seeing the ocean for the first time:] ‘[never before has he seen, what, a river that is so very big like this ocean,] never before has he seen you, you river can be wide like this?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Appositions may be restrictive or nonrestrictive. In restrictive \isi{apposition}, the second appositive limits or clarifies the first unit. In nonrestrictive \isi{apposition}, by contrast, the second appositive is added as an optional additional piece of information \citep[182–188]{Morley.2000}. The same applies to Papuan Malay \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} appositions; that is, depending on their semantic function within the clause, the appositions may be restrictive or nonrestrictive. The referent is typically human with consultants agreeing that \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} expressions with nonhuman referents are unacceptable. The corpus contains only one exception in which the referent is an inanimate entity, presented in (\ref{Example_6.1}), repeated as (\ref{Example_6.41}). The construction in (\ref{Example_6.41}), however, involves “a \textstyleChItalic{personification} of the nonhuman object that is addressed”, as \citet[314]{Abrams.2009} describe it (for details on such figures of speech see §\ref{Para_6.2.1.1.3}).

One question for further research is whether these constructions could instead be analyzed as \isi{noun} phrases with pre-head pronouns. It is expected that such preposed pronouns would have an individuating function given that other pre-head determiners, namely numerals and quantifiers, also have an individuating function (see §\ref{Para_8.3}). One problem with such an analysis, however, would be \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} constructions with singular pronouns, as in (\ref{Example_6.39}) to (\ref{Example_6.43}), given that singular pronouns would hardly have an individuating function.

Question 321:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ... yo, akirnya sa ... \textbar ... ___ berdoa berdoa
Gloss (with missing item): ... yes finally 1SG ... ... ... ___ pray pray
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[so in fifth grade she broke-off school,] yes, finally I, (a/her) mother, prayed (and) prayed’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the number of referents encoded by the apposited \isi{noun} phrase is limited to two, Papuan Malay speakers also use dual constructions in which the \isi{pronoun} is modified with the \isi{numeral} \textitbf{dua} ‘two’, such that ``\textsc{pro-pl} \textitbf{dua} \textsc{np}'', as in (\ref{Example_6.48}). In the corpus, however, such constructions are rare and the dual constructions are always formed with the third person plural \isi{pronoun}.\footnote{The \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} constructions presented in this section were analyzed as appositions. One question for further research is whether these constructions could instead be analyzed as \isi{noun} phrases with pre-head pronouns. It is expected that such preposed pronouns would have an individuating function given that other pre-head determiners, namely numerals and quantifiers, also have an individuating function (see §\ref{Para_8.3}). One problem with such an analysis, however, would be \textsc{pro} \textsc{np} constructions with singular pronouns, as in (\ref{Example_6.39}) to (\ref{Example_6.43}), given that singular pronouns would hardly have an individuating function. (For a discussion of the determiner function of post-head pronouns see §\ref{Para_6.2}.)}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the head nominal is a common \isi{noun}, second person \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘\textsc{2sg}’ indicates which particular individual is being referred to. Thereby the \isi{pronoun} allows the unambiguous identification of the addressee as the intended referent. Often speakers choose this strategy when they address an individual in a group of several interlocutors as in (\ref{Example_6.51}) and (\ref{Example_6.52}), or when they give an order to someone, as in (\ref{Example_6.53}) and (\ref{Example_6.54}).

The English translation of this sentence is:[Addressing a young boy:] ‘you Wili don’t irritate that aunt!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When \textitbf{ko} ‘\textsc{2sg}’ co-occurs with a \isi{proper noun}, as in (\ref{Example_6.53}) or (\ref{Example_6.54}), one might argue that such \isi{noun} phrases are redundant with the \isi{pronoun} as adnominal determiner being superfluous, since proper nouns are inherently \isi{definite}. In Papuan Malay, however, \textsc{np} \textsc{2sg} expressions constitute direct speech-act strategies which allow speakers to single out participants and to mark them unambiguously as the intended referents of the proper nouns. Being addressed with such a \textsc{np} \textsc{2sg} \isi{noun} phrase leaves the addressees little room for interpretation. Thereby, \textsc{np} \textsc{2sg} nouns phrases are much more direct than the indirect strategies presented in (\ref{Example_6.55}) and (\ref{Example_6.56}),

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The example in (\ref{Example_6.59}) is part of a story about a fight between \textitbf{its gloss ___} and \textitbf{Fitri}, with the speaker relating how \textitbf{its gloss ___} attacked \textitbf{Fitri}. Notably, neither \textitbf{its gloss ___} nor \textitbf{Fitri} were present when the speaker recounted the incident. When mentioned the first time, \textitbf{its gloss ___} is marked as a third-person actor, as is typical of narratives with non-speech-act participants. Later in the discourse, however, \textitbf{its gloss ___} is marked as the addressee. More specifically, the speaker first refers to \textitbf{its gloss ___} with the \textsc{np} \textsc{3sg} \isi{noun} phrase \textitbf{its gloss ___ dia lewat} ‘its gloss ___ went past’ (literally ‘he its gloss ___’) (see also §\ref{Para_6.2.1.2}). Next, the speaker refers to \textitbf{its gloss ___} with the third person singular \isi{pronoun} in \textitbf{de lompat} ‘he jumped’. Now \textitbf{Fitri} returns the attack and kicks \textitbf{its gloss ___} badly. At this point, the speaker interrupts the flow of her narrative about the two non-speech-act participants and employs the \textsc{np} \textsc{2sg} \isi{noun} phrase \textitbf{its gloss ___ ko} ‘you its gloss ___’ to relate that \textitbf{its gloss ___} fell to the ground. In turning away from her audience and addressing absent \textitbf{its gloss ___}, the speaker gives “emotional impetus” to the fact that \textitbf{its gloss ___} went down after having been kicked by a woman, thereby creating an emotional reaction in her audience.

Two of these repetitions are presented in (\ref{Example_6.86}) and (\ref{Example_6.87}). It is noted that the speakers do not repeat the respective bare nouns \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ and \textitbf{Markus}, but the \textsc{np} \textsc{3sg} expressions \textitbf{the morpheme ___ de} ‘the its gloss ___’ (literally ‘he its gloss ___’) and \textitbf{Markus de} ‘Markus’ (literally ‘he Markus’). This suggests that they perceive these expressions to be cohesive entities which, in turn, supports their analysis as single \isi{noun} phrases.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cross-linguistically, the additive interpretation implies referential homogeneity of the group. That is, “every referent of the plural form is also a referent of the stem” \citep[1]{Daniel.2013}. This additive reading of Papuan Malay \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} is illustrated in (\ref{Example_6.90}) to (\ref{Example_6.92}). In (\ref{Example_6.90}), \textitbf{kitorang} ‘\textsc{1pl}’ denotes the plurality of its bare head nominal \textitbf{nene} ‘grandmother’, while in (\ref{Example_6.91}) \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ signals the plurality of \textitbf{bangsat} ‘rascal’, and in (\ref{Example_6.92}) \textitbf{dong} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ indicates the plurality of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ Oktofina 2PL go.home hour several
The English translation of this sentence is:‘what time did you aunt Oktofina and your companions including you (Oktofina) come home?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The reading of Papuan Malay \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} \isi{noun} phrases is not only \isi{associative}, however. Adopting \citegen[479]{Moravcsik.2003} analysis, the reading of such \isi{noun} phrases is also “inclusory”, in that “all members of the plural set are summarily referred to by a \isi{pronoun}” (see also \citealt[25]{Haspelmath.2004}; \citealt{Gil.2009}). That is, the reference of the plural \isi{pronoun} in a Papuan Malay \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} \isi{noun} phrase includes the reference of the focal referent, such that ``\textsc{pro} including X''. In (\ref{Example_6.95}), for instance, the \isi{pronoun} \textitbf{kam} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ includes not only the companions and the speaker, but all members of the plural set, “including \textitbf{Oktofina}”. That is, the \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} \isi{noun} phrase \textitbf{Oktofina kam} does not signal an additive relation in the sense of ``Oktofina plus you companions''. Likewise in (\ref{Example_6.96}), the reference of \textitbf{dorang} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ includes not only the associates of the focal referent \textitbf{Pawlus}, but all members of the plural set, ``including Pawlus''.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The reading of Papuan Malay \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} \isi{noun} phrases is not only \isi{associative}, however. Adopting \citegen[479]{Moravcsik.2003} analysis, the reading of such \isi{noun} phrases is also “inclusory”, in that “all members of the plural set are summarily referred to by a \isi{pronoun}” (see also \citealt[25]{Haspelmath.2004}; \citealt{Gil.2009}). That is, the reference of the plural \isi{pronoun} in a Papuan Malay \textsc{n} \textsc{pro-pl} \isi{noun} phrase includes the reference of the focal referent, such that ``\textsc{pro} including X''.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘you Ise just stay here with aunt and her companions including aunt!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As for the lexical classes employed in \isi{associative plural} expressions, \citet[3]{Daniel.2013} observe “a clear preference for \isi{associative} plurals formed from proper names over kin terms over non-kin human common nouns over nonhuman nouns”. This also applies to Papuan Malay, in that the focal referents in \isi{associative} inclusory expressions are formed from human nouns while nonhuman animate focal referents are unattested. Among human nouns in the corpus, however, kin terms as in (\ref{Example_6.98}) are more common than proper names as in (\ref{Example_6.95}). This has to do with the fact that culturally people prefer not to use proper names, if they have another option, especially if the person is older and/or present. In addition, although not very often, \isi{associative plural} expressions are formed from non-kin terms such as the title \isi{noun} expression \textitbf{bapa desa} ‘father mayor’ in (\ref{Example_6.97}), or the common \isi{noun} \textitbf{dokter} ‘doctor’ in (\ref{Example_6.99}).
