Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ baso ya.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ glass DEF.F
The English translation of this sentence is:`That glass is shattered.' \hspace{1cm}STATE
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref398301852} and \REF{bkm:Ref398301854} illustrate the root the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’, which is a non-volitio\-nal root of Class I. With no inflectional affixes this root describes a simple state \REF{bkm:Ref398301852}. This may be considered a non-verbal, modification predicate (see \chapref{chap:non-verbalclauses}, \sectref{sec:predicatemodifiers}). In \REF{bkm:Ref398301854}, with happenstantial marking it describes the perfective achievement of its gloss ___ing. As with all Class I verbs, this root does not occur in dynamic modality (*gathe morpheme ___/*magthe morpheme ___). This makes sense since its gloss ___ing is a punctual event, therefore the root that expresses this concept cannot describe an activity, since activities are inherently non-punctual:
A: word: buong	 gloss: shatter
B: word: na-buong	 gloss: A.HAP.R-shatter
C: word: tapos	 gloss: then
D: word: ga-seddep	 gloss: I.R-go.in.small.space

Sentence (with missing item): Piro naan aren ta tudtod ta pambot na ___ na sigi en anod.
Gloss (with missing item): but SPAT.DEF 1S.ABS NABS back NABS boat LK ___ LK continuously CM drift
The English translation of this sentence is:‘But I was on the back of the boat which had turned over that was continuously now adrift.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Several roots, such as daeb ‘to turn face down’ may present non-volitional situations with an inanimate Undergoer, or volitional situations with an animate Actor. As such these roots fall logically into Class II and Class IV. When the absolutive is an inanimate Undergoer they exhibit the affixation pattern of Class II roots, and when the absolutive is an animate Actor, they exhibit the pattern of Class IV roots. Here we give some examples of the Class II usage. The following examples are from the same text, and describe the same discourse event. However, in \REF{bkm:Ref148966026} happenstantial modality is used, while in \REF{bkm:Ref148965908} dynamic modality occurs. In \REF{bkm:Ref148966026} the act of turning over is non-volitional and is on the event line of the narrative. In this context, happenstantial modality is expected, and can be understood as expressing a semantic perfective aspect.
A: word: ga-daeb	 gloss: I.R-turn.over
B: word: ga-dagbeng	 gloss: I.R-thud
C: word: ga-iling	 gloss: I.R-go
D: word: buong	 gloss: shatter

Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Piro naan aren ta tudtod ta pambot na ___ na sigi en anod.
Gloss (with missing item): but SPAT.DEF 1S.ABS NABS back NABS boat LK ___ LK continuously CM drift
The English translation of this sentence is:‘But I was on the back of the boat which had turned over that was continuously now adrift.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{bkm:Ref148965908} the same verb occurs, but this time it is not on the main event line of the narrative. It simply describes the condition of the boat that resulted from the event of turning over narrated earlier in the story. In this case, dynamic modality is appropriate. If happenstantial were used again in this context, the intention would be that the boat turned over a second time, constituting another event on the main event line of the story. This would have been possible, but highly unusual inside a relative clause.
A: word: ga-daeb	 gloss: I.R-turn.over
B: word: ga-dagbeng	 gloss: I.R-thud
C: word: ga-iling	 gloss: I.R-go
D: word: leddang-en	 gloss: sink-T.IR

Gloss (with missing item): if/when EXT.IN ___ LK A.HAP.R-fall think/count-T.IR 2S.ERG because D3ABS D3ABS.PR coconut LK A.HAP.R-pick 1S.ERG
The English translation of this sentence is:‘If something falls making a thud sound, count it because that very one is the coconut I have picked.’ (The speaker climbs a tree to get coconuts and he tells the blind guy on the ground to count how many thuds he hears because that will be the coconuts that he picks and lets fall to the ground. But the one who climbs the tree keeps falling out and so the blind guy counts each time the other guy falls out of the tree thinking it is a coconut.)

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most Class I-III verbs can be used in a transitive frame with no transitivizing stem-forming morphology (applicative or causative). In this case they express direct causation. Example \REF{ex:hasdissolved} illustrates the Class II root tunaw ‘to dissolve/melt’ in its basic intransitive frame, while example \REF{bkm:Ref395126196} illustrates the same root in a transitive, causative, frame:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘I made/let him/her return to their house.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another grammatical difference between non-volitional and volitional intransitive roots is that non-volitional roots may easily occur in a transitive frame to express direct causation (see \sectref{bkm:Ref148856716} above). Class IV roots, on the other hand, almost always require explicit transitivizing stem-forming morphology, either causative (pa{}-) or applicative (-an, -i) in order to occur in a transitive frame. This is because the causee is often animate, and therefore retains some control over the situation. However, if the causee is inanimate or otherwise incapable of controlling the situation, some of these roots may express direct causation in a transitive frame without the stem-forming causative prefix. For example, roots such as balik ‘return’, tago ‘hide’ and others that describe motion to a destination (return to a place, hide in a place) when used intransitively describe volitional situations \REF{bkm:Ref148946728}. When the same roots describe caused situations in which the causee is capable of exercising some control over the situation, the causative prefix is used, as in \REF{bkm:Ref148968257}. However, the same verbs may occur in a transitive \REF{bkm:Ref148946793} or detransitive \REF{bkm:Ref148946893} construction with no causative prefix, in which case they imply that the causee is probably inanimate, and therefore has no control or volition. In other words, as with root Classes I-III, this construction expresses direct causation:
A: word: pa-pa-balik	 gloss: T.R-CAUS-return

C: word: lasa	 gloss: taste

Sentence (with missing item): Aso ta apoy ___ en ta lungag…
Gloss (with missing item): smoke NABS fire ___ CM NABS hole
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The smoke of the fire went inside the hole….’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref148965959} is from a story about a raid on the island of Cagayancillo. A group of Kagayanens were hiding in a cave (referred to as a “hole”), and the attackers set a fire at the entrance to the cave such that everyone inside died except one woman. This was a volitional act on the part of the raiders, though the absolutive argument, the smoke, is not itself volitional:

B: word: na-seddep-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-go.in.small.space-APL

Sentence (with missing item): Ta buļan na ga-ligad ___ ko a masakit na swalem.
Gloss (with missing item): NABS month/moon LK I.R-pass.by ___ 1S.ERG INJ sick LK chickenpox
The English translation of this sentence is:‘In the month that passed by I experienced the sickness of chickenpox.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The root agi may take dynamic affixes, in which case it expresses the meaning of ‘to pass somewhere’, and falls into Class IV. However, when occurring with happenstantial affixes, it has the somewhat idiomatic meaning of ‘to experience’, as a sickness (example \ref{bkm:Ref150244144}). In this case the experiencer is expressed as ergative, and the source of the experience as absolutive. Therefore in this usage it falls into Subclass Vb:
A: word: na-agi-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-experience-APL
B: word: agi-an	 gloss: pass-APL
C: word: na-aļaman	 gloss: A.HAP.R-know-APL
D: word: ayad	 gloss: well

It may or may not be the result of a volitional act of throwing, shooting, etc. (as in \ref{bkm:Ref150345606}), but the event of hitting is presented as happenstantial.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref150434299} through \REF{bkm:Ref150430302} illustrate Group 2 verbs from Classes IV, VI, VII, and VIII that may take m{}- as well as mag{}- as the intransitive, irrealis inflection. Sometimes there is no discernible difference in meaning between the two forms, while other times the m{}- forms describe more immediate, inevitable situations. The mag{}- forms tend to describe more non-specific, habitual situations, often in combination with another clause in the same construction. Example \REF{bkm:Ref150434299} illustrates the culminative usage of irrealis modality (see \chapref{chap:verbstructure}, \sectref{sec:intransitiveirrealis}):
