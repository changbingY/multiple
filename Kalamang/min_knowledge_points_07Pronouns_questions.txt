Sentence (with missing item): ___ et-putkaruok koluk
Gloss (with missing item): ___ CLF_AN-thirteen find
The English translation of this sentence is:`We caught thirteen pieces.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Dual number is created by suffixing -ier to the basic pronouns. This might be a metathesis\is{metathesis} of eir `two'. Dual forms are not obligatory, but are used in the great majority of the cases where a pronoun refers to two referents. When there are more than two referents, the speaker can choose between a basic pronoun with or without a suffixed \is{numeral}numeral. The higher the number of referents, the lower the share of pronouns with a suffixed numeral.\footnote{This observation is impressionistic. It is based on a corpus search for pronouns with a suffixed numeral. A confounding factor is that lower numerals are more common than higher numerals.} (\ref{exe:mier}) shows dual number, and~(\ref{exe:munggansuor}) shows the numeral kansuor `four' suffixed to the third-person plural.\is{metathesis}\is{number!pronominal}

Sentence (with missing item): kon eir karuok kansuor ___ melelu
Gloss (with missing item): one two three four ___ sit
The English translation of this sentence is:`One, two, three, four, they six sit.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although suffixing a numeral to a pronoun is less and less common the higher the number of referents, there are several instances in the corpus where speakers count the number of referents to make sure they refer to them in the correct way (as in~\ref{exe:muraman}, where the number of people in a picture is counted), or check with their addressee whether they are referring to the correct number of people, as in~(\ref{exe:mupuraman}). In~(\ref{exe:muraman}) it is unclear whether raman=a should be analysed as a suffix to the pronoun or as an independent numeral, but since the corpus contains examples with `two', `three' and `four' that are suffixed, I take it that `six' is, too.
A: word: mu-raman=a	 gloss: 3PL-six=FOC

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: (\ref{exe:marain}) and~(\ref{exe:andain}) illustrate the -tain series with restrictive or contrastive focus\is{pronoun!focus}. In~(\ref{exe:marain}), where people describe a picture from the Family problems picture task\is{picture-matching task} \parencite{carroll2009}, there are clearly more referents to choose from, but the speaker wishes to focus on `him alone'. In~(\ref{exe:andain}), from the same recording, the speaker explains that the man in the task, who has come out of jail and has become a better person, improved himself on his own. There were perhaps more candidates for the source of his improvement, but the speaker wishes to convey that the man did it all alone.
