A: word: aakun-e-mik	 gloss: talk-PA-1/3p

When searching for translation equivalents for comparison forms, they often start with the Conjoined Comparative pattern, but very soon after realising that they do not have to stay within the limits of stative clauses only or stick to the adjective class, many actually tend to prefer the Exceed Comparative as the more natural and accurate expression for comparison. \citet[68]{Reesink1987} mentions both of these mechanisms for Usan. } There are two clauses in this pattern too: one may be equative and contain an adjective, the other is a transitive clause containing the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nomak}- `exceed/surpass' as the predicate and the standard of comparison as the object \REF{ex:6:x1327}--\REF{ex:6:x1333}.
