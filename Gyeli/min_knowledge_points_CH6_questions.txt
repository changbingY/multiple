Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent Within a specific context requiring common ground for the speech act participants, however, the sentence in \REF{PRES1} can alternatively relate to a time that follows speech time. The \textsc{present} can thus be used to refer to future events as well as present ones. It is hard to delimit how far into the future the \textsc{present} may refer, and does not seem to be categorically bounded by, for instance, time of day or even periods of multiple days. Especially when temporal adverbs or other means of time reference are used, as in \REF{presfut},\footnote{The speaker was not in Ngolo when he uttered this sentence. The verb {\itshape kɛ̀} `go' has an altrilocal meaning, as described in \sectref{sec:ComplSemi}, and is not a grammatical means of marking future tense.} the grammatical \textsc{present} form can extend into at least several days in the future.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The sentence in \REF{PST2a} illustrates both the subjective time distance to the event and the pluperfect interpretation. In this example, the chief of Ngolo talks about the dangers of the Bagyeli's lifestyle and points to a scar on his face that he got from a machete.

Gloss (with missing item): LOC over.there ___ found-PST
The English translation of this sentence is:`I had originally settled over there [and since then I moved to the new place].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same is true for his statement in \REF{PST2b}. Here, he talks about the former settlement before the current village of Ngolo was built. Again, it is not objectively inferrable whether the speaker had settled in the former village when he was a child or a young man or even only two years ago. Using the \textsc{remote past}, however, shows that in terms of relevance to the present situation, settling in the old village is rather remote.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Excuse me, go and ask [my] namesake [the other Nzambi] for a little to eat.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent In narratives, they occur in the form of reported direct speech, as in \REF{impdrd}, where the \textsc{imperative} form is, in fact, the indicator of reported discourse through a switch of the deictic perspective.

The English translation of this sentence is:`When it goes into my arm . . . the bamboo can sting your arm.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{subjunctive} can further be used in a consecutive context, as in \REF{SBJVa}, which lacks an animate entity that could have wishes or intentions. When translating these phrases, speakers consistently assign the French verb {\itshape vouloir} `want' to the inanimate entity. %The example further shows that the \textsc{stamp} marker usually preceding the \textsc{subjunctive} form can be elided.
A: word: nyíì	 gloss: enter.SBJV

The English translation of this sentence is:`I say that there ought to be enough tin (roofed) houses here for me.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{subjunctive} expresses bouletic modality, as in \REF{Bouletic}, which concerns the speaker's desire in relation to what is necessary or possible. Other types of modality, e.g.\ deontic or dynamic, are encoded by semi-auxiliaries in complex predicates \sectref{sec:ComplSemi}.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ H-be-kwàndɔ̀
Gloss (with missing item): ___ OBJ.LINK-be8-plantain
The English translation of this sentence is:`Cook (sg.) plantains!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples of the irrealis tense-mood categories are given in \REF{noM}. The finite verbs in these sentences do not take the grammatical H tone; they are only inflected for their tense-mood category as basic simple predicates \REF{sec:GramTM}.\footnote{The second person plural and the cohortative in the \textsc{imperative} category have the same tonal pattern on the verb as \REF{noM2}, but the tonal structure of the object noun is different due to the postverbal plural particle. As this concerns, however, the syntactic H tone rather than the realis-marking grammatical H tone, this phenomenon is discussed in \sectref{sec:HLinker}.}
A: word: gyámbô	 gloss: cook.IMP

The English translation of this sentence is:`They want to cook plantains.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is, however, only the finite verb that undergoes tonal change. If a second, non-finite verb is not intonation phrase-final, it keeps its default tones, as shown in \REF{MetaPOS2}. In this example, the modal verb {\itshape wúmbɛ} `want' takes the grammatical H tone that indicates the realis category. The final tone on {\itshape gyámbɔ} `cook' surfaces as L.
A: word: wúmbɛ-h	 gloss: want-R
B: word: wúmbɛ-h	 gloss: want-R

The English translation of this sentence is:`He does not eat mangoes.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent Since the negated verb in \REF{leOBJd} surfaces with an H tone, one could assume that the H tone has merged with the realis-marking H tone. Since verbs of the pattern in \REF{leOBJb} do not take a verb-final H tone, however, I treat all negated verb forms in the \textsc{present} as having their own, fixed tonal pattern that lacks the grammatical H tone. The negated \textsc{present} thus belongs to the irrealis mood, which constitutes a paradigmatic asymmetry in comparison to the positive \textsc{present}.
A: word: dè-lɛ	 gloss: eat-NEG

The English translation of this sentence is:`I often arrive.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The reduplicated stem follows the original stem in the form of a suffix as opposed to constituting an independent word. Evidence for this comes from the duplicate's tonal pattern. First, the duplicate is underlyingly toneless, while the original stem is specified for its first TBU. \REF{habitual1} shows that {\itshape pándɛ} `arrive' carries its lexical H tone on the first TBU in the stem, but this lexical H tone does not appear on the toneless duplicate, which might even lose more features of the stem, such as vowel length and nasalization, as shown in \REF{HAB2}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I have read this book [more general/experiential].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The example compares different aspect meanings in the situation of reading a book. If {\itshape mɔ̀} is used, the interpretation is that the book has been read entirely. Therefore, I call this aspect category \textsc{absolute completive}. In comparison, the semi-auxiliary {\itshape sílɛ} `finish', also carries a completive meaning in that the person has finished reading the book. The use of {\itshape sílɛ}, however, does not entail that the book has been read in its entirety, just that the subject has stopped reading (parts of) it. Therefore, I label this aspect \textsc{non-complete accomplishment}. The \textsc{perfect} use in \REF{MPL3} suggests a more general and maybe experiential reading.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Finally, the \textsc{absolute completive} is used in more figurative and idiomatic ways. In \REF{mo8}, for instance, Nzambi's wife states that she is starving, using the \textsc{absolute completive} for {\itshape wɛ̀} `die', even though, obviously, she is still alive.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I have cooked the food.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I consider the \textsc{absolute completive} to indicate the realis mood, since the finite verb always surfaces with a final H tone, which is characteristic of this mood category (\sectref{sec:GramTM} and \sectref{sec:SynH}). In comparison to other simple predicate constructions, the verb in the \textsc{absolute completive} never appears phrase finally, since the \textsc{absolute completive} marker {\itshape mɔ̀} behaves as a post-verbal element. In \REF{PROGtone1A}, the grammatical H tone thus appears on the final vowel of {\itshape gyámbɔ} `cook'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I have cooked the food.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The more grammaticalized variant in \REF{PROGtone2A} also carries the H tone. Here, the verb and the \textsc{completive} marker {\itshape mɔ̀} have fused, resulting in a long final vowel that is nasalized and that reflects the tonal pattern of the {\itshape mɔ̀} variant: first the grammatical H tone and then the L tone of the postverbal aspect marker, surfacing as a long HL vowel.

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ cook OBJ.LINK-be8-food
The English translation of this sentence is:`I am cooking food.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Special pattern 1 includes the \textsc{present progressive} with {\itshape nzíí}, the \textsc{subordinate progressive} with {\itshape nzɛ́ɛ́}, and the \textsc{present} tense use with {\itshape tí}. This pattern is characterized by a \textsc{stamp} marker that surfaces with an L tone and a verb with an H tone. On the surface, this looks identical to the \textsc{recent past} pattern of simple predicates. Since the auxiliary, however, can never occur phrase finally, as it always requires a non-finite verb, it is not clear what underlying tone pattern the auxiliary verb has and thus whether it is indeed identical to the \textsc{recent past}. Given that this (on-the-surface) identical tone pattern occurs in different predicate construction types and has different functions, while the underlying tone pattern of the verb is not discernible, I consider the special pattern 1 as distinct from the \textsc{recent past}. All categories that take the special pattern 1 occur in \textsc{present} tense ({\itshape nzíí} and {\itshape tí}) or tenseless ({\itshape nzɛ́ɛ́}) contexts. I suggest that, with these highly grammaticalized auxiliaries, the \textsc{stamp} marker is deprived of the H tone that surfaces on the \textsc{stamp} markers in simple predicate \textsc{present}. Tense information in these complex constructions is thus encoded lexically in the auxiliary, as in \REF{nzii1}.

Sentence (with missing item): mɛ̀ɛ̀ bɛ̀ mɛ ___ kɛ̀
Gloss (with missing item): db1SG.FUT be db1SG ___ go
The English translation of this sentence is:`I will be going.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In contrast, the tenseless \textsc{progressive} auxiliary {\itshape the morpheme ___} is a dependent form that occurs in three environments: (i) in the second constituent of a complex predicate construction with a double \textsc{stamp} marker (\sectref{sec:Compbe}), (ii) in a subordinate clause where {\itshape the morpheme ___} is the only marker of subordination (\sectref{sec:SUBnzee}), and (iii) in a complement clauses with {\itshape nâ} (\sectref{sec:CompC}). \REF{nzee2} provides an instance of a complex predicate with a double \textsc{stamp} marker, where the referent of the \textsc{stamp} marker is identical for both constituents. As {\itshape the morpheme ___} is generally not specified for tense, tense-mood information is encoded in the first constituent, which involves {\itshape bɛ̀} `be'. Although the first constituent anchors the event in the \textsc{future}, which belongs to the irrealis mood, {\itshape the morpheme ___} always occurs with a realis-marking H tone, irrespective of the tense-mood category of the first constituent in a complex predicate (or the matrix clause).

The English translation of this sentence is:`I will be going.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In contrast to \REF{nzee2}, the structure in \REF{nzee} is not a complex predicate, but a case of ``linkless'' subordination. Although, on the surface, both examples look similar, \REF{nzee} is not an instance of joint predication, since the two \textsc{stamp} markers refer to different entities: the second person singular in the first constituent and the first person singular in the second constituent. Another difference from \REF{nzee2} is that the finite verb in the first constituent is not the auxiliary {\itshape bɛ̀} `be'. Nevertheless, the tenseless \textsc{progressive} auxiliary {\itshape the morpheme ___} is used in this context, since both predicates share the same tense specification, anchoring the second constituent temporally at the time of the first.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The same is true for conditional clauses (\sectref{sec:Cond}), as in \REF{nzee5}. The reason for this is most likely that these types of dependent clauses do not necessarily anchor the time of the subordinate clause at the same time of the matrix clause, even though these times can be identical, as in \REF{nzee5}. Therefore, the tenseless auxiliary {\itshape nzɛ́ɛ́} is prohibited.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Gyeli \textsc{progressive} aspect does not seem to be restricted to any particular verb classes. Whereas English, for instance, disprefers \textsc{progressives} with verbs expressing states, in Gyeli all kinds of verbs can occur with the \textsc{progressive}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The phrase in \REF{progback3} is a particularly good illustration of the fact that, in these instances, the \textsc{progressive} form is most likely not concerned with an ongoing event, since the verb {\itshape wɛ̀} `die' is typically punctual rather than ongoing.

Question 92:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ lɔ́ dè
Gloss (with missing item): ___ RETRO.R eat
The English translation of this sentence is:`He has just eaten [{\itshape Il vient de manger}].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{retrospective} auxiliary is the counterpart to the \textsc{prospective} (\sectref{sec:PROSP}) on the time line, looking back at the endpoint of an event that has just taken place. It is likely a loan construction from French {\itshape venir de faire quelque chose} `just having done something [lit. come from doing something]', while the lexeme {\itshape lɔ́} is a loanword from Basaa (A42), with the meaning `come' in Basaa. Although speakers are aware of the Basaa meaning, {\itshape lɔ́} does not have any lexical meaning in Gyeli nor does it occur outside of the \textsc{retrospective} context. I therefore gloss {\itshape lɔ́} only with its grammatical category instead of a lexical meaning. The \textsc{retrospective} auxiliary has only been observed to occur with eventive verbs and animate subjects in the corpus. It is restricted to the \textsc{present} (unlike French, where it can also be used in other tenses). Accordingly, \textsc{stamp} markers carry the \textsc{present} H tone, as shown in \REF{lo1}, while the verb {\itshape lɔ́} always occurs with a realis-marking H tone.\footnote{Since {\itshape lɔ́} never occurs phrase finally in Gyeli, there is no proof of any underlying tone. I therefore gloss {\itshape lɔ́} with an H tone also in the underlying form, which inherently carries the realis-marking grammatical H tone.} Unlike in the \textsc{prospective}, all \textsc{stamp} markers carry the same tone in this aspect category, as \REF{lo1a} and \REF{lo1b} show.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ lɔ́ dè

The English translation of this sentence is:`They have just eaten.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{retrospective} auxiliary is the counterpart to the \textsc{prospective} (\sectref{sec:PROSP}) on the time line, looking back at the endpoint of an event that has just taken place.

Sentence (with missing item): áh gyí wɛ-H ___ njì gyɛ́sɔ
Gloss (with missing item): EXCL what 2SG-PRS ___ come look.for
The English translation of this sentence is:`Ah, what have you just come to look for?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distance between speech time and the time of the event is typically short. In \REF{lo2}, for instance, the speech time follows the event of `coming to look for' immediately, while the event has ongoing affects during speech time. The addressee of the question is still present and is still looking for something.

Gloss (with missing item): so 1-PRS ___ say COMP LOC like.this 2SG.PRS.NEG work-NEG OBJ.LINK-be8-food
The English translation of this sentence is:`So he just said: ``Like this, you don't work for your food''.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are, however, also instances in the corpus where more time has elapsed between the situation and the utterance. In \REF{lo4}, Nzambi's wife comes home after having lost her child and now explains the situation to her husband, namely that the husband's friend has taken the child in return for food. She reports that the friend had said that they don't work hard enough to earn their food. Between the situation where the friend said this (the retrospect situation) and the time of utterance, the wife has left the friend's home, walked all the way back to her own home, had cried, and had gotten picked up by her husband. Thus, in this case, situation and speech time are not at all proximate.

The English translation of this sentence is:`So he just said: ``Like this, you don't work for your food''.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{retrospective} aspect is often viewed as \textsc{perfect} in the literature, and the example in \REF{lo4} could be taken as such. As \citet[64]{comrie76} states, the perfect is retrospective in that it establishes ``a relation between a state at one time and a situation at an earlier time''. As shown in this section, the Gyeli \textsc{retrospective} is different from Comrie's retrospectivity of the perfect. The Gyeli \textsc{perfect} has a distinct form, as I show in \sectref{sec:PSTPRF}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`S/he is about to eat.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{prospective} marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} `be almost' is the only aspect category that belongs to the irrealis mood, in Gyeli which is characterized by the absence of a realis-marking grammatical H tone on the auxiliary verb, as shown in \REF{mua}. It is similar to the \textsc{future} irrealis category also in that the \textsc{stamp} markers of the first and second person singular as well as the class 1 \textsc{stamp} marker show a different tonal pattern from the other agreement classes, as contrasted between \REF{mua1} and \ref{mua2}.\footnote{See \sectref{sec:ComplAUX} for more information on tonal patterns of the \textsc{stamp} marker in complex predicates with true auxiliaries.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`I'm almost in town.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since the \textsc{prospective} marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} has a lexical meaning, `be almost', I gloss {\itshape the morpheme ___} with its meaning rather than the grammatical category that it encodes. This is consistent with cases where {\itshape the morpheme ___} `be almost' occurs in a simple predicate without another finite verb, as in \REF{Rmua1}.

Speakers usually translate the use of this aspect marker in \REF{mua1} into Cameroonian French as {\itshape Je veux/vais déjà manger} `I want/will already eat'. In a detailed description of the situation in \REF{mua1}, speakers explain that a person would already be sitting at a table with a plate of food, being in the state of just being about to start eating.

The English translation of this sentence is:`S/he is about to eat.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The French modals used in translation also reflect the future orientation of the Gyeli \textsc{prospective}, similarly to what \citet{matthewson2012} describes for Gitksan (Tsimshianic; British Columbia, Canada) modals. This future orientation explains the affiliation to the irrealis mood. Even though in terms of alternative realities, it is highly probable that the person in \REF{mua1} will indeed engage in the described event, this is probably not the case for \REF{muaa}.

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ die COM emptyset9.hunger
The English translation of this sentence is:`I'm about to die from hunger.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The French modals used in translation also reflect the future orientation of the Gyeli \textsc{prospective}, similarly to what \citet{matthewson2012} describes for Gitksan (Tsimshianic; British Columbia, Canada) modals. This future orientation explains the affiliation to the irrealis mood. Even though in terms of alternative realities, it is highly probable that the person in \REF{mua1} will indeed engage in the described event, this is probably not the case for \REF{muaa}.
A: word: múà	 gloss: be.almost

Sentence (with missing item): nyɛ nâ a ___ wɛ̂ bíyɔ dẽ́
Gloss (with missing item): 1 COMP 1 ___ 2SG.OBJ hit today
The English translation of this sentence is:`He [says] that he is about to beat you today.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent This example shows that the prospected event is not inevitable and at the point of utterance, it is not certain that it will really happen. The same is true for \REF{Rmua2}, where the beating is probable, but not certain.
A: word: múà	 gloss: be.almost

Sentence (with missing item): a ___ njì lã̀ báà bù mpàgó
Gloss (with missing item): 1 ___ come pass 2.FUT break ∅3.road
The English translation of this sentence is:`It [the port] is about to come and pass [by here], they will build the road.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{prospective} does not seem to be restricted to any particular verb classes: it can occur with both eventive and stative verbs. Further, its subjects can be both animate and inanimate. The latter is exemplified in \REF{muab}, where the speaker is talking about the port that is about to also affect the village of Ngolo.

Sentence (with missing item): yɔ́ɔ̀ ba-Nzàmbí bá tè ba ___ sɔ́
Gloss (with missing item): so ba2-PN 2:ATT there 2.PST1 ___ ∅1.friend
The English translation of this sentence is:`So, the Nzambis there had been friends.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Just like the \textsc{prospective} verb {\itshape múà}, {\itshape bwàà} can occur in simple predicates without another non-finite verb, namely when expressing identity relations, as in \REF{Pbwaa1}.
A: word: bwàà-h	 gloss: have-R

Sentence (with missing item): a ___ yɛ́ɛ́ kɛ̀-H jì mpù
Gloss (with missing item): 1 ___ then go-R stay like.this
The English translation of this sentence is:`He [the other Nzambi] has gone and stood like this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \textsc{perfect} auxiliary verb {\itshape bwàà} is rather rare, both in the corpus and in the data gathered based on \posscitet{dahl85} TMA Questionnaire. It is thus challenging to delimit a core meaning for this category. At the same time, the \textsc{perfect} seems to be similar to other aspects, such as the \textsc{retrospective} and \textsc{absolute completive}, in the sense that the situation has been completed by speech time. In comparison to the \textsc{retrospective}, however, the emphasis of the \textsc{perfect} is on a relatively long period of time between the situation and speech time. The Gyeli \textsc{perfect} is usually translated into Cameroonian French with a perfect construction and the adverb {\itshape depuis} `since', which gives the meaning of `a long time ago'. Thus, the phrase in \REF{bwaa2} is consistently translated as {\itshape Il est depuis allé rester comme ça} `He has since gone and stayed like that'.\footnote{Despite this translation and a possible implication of anteriority, I do not label {\itshape bwàà} as past perfect, since this would require an anteriority relation to another thematically connected event in the past \citep{lee2017}. This other event in the past, however, is not given either in \REF{bwaa2} or in \REF{bwaa3a}.}

Sentence (with missing item): a ___ vòwa
Gloss (with missing item): 1.PST1 ___ wake
The English translation of this sentence is:`He has woken up already (a while ago).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Also data from the ``EUROTYP Perfect Questionnaire'' \citep{dahl2000} support the claim that {\itshape bwàà} is used when the situation is temporally distant from speech time. \REF{bwaa3} shows two possible responses to the command `Don't speak so loud, you will wake up the baby', in which, in both cases, the person replies that the baby is already awake. For \REF{bwaa3a}, in which {\itshape bwàà} is used, speakers explain that the baby has already woken up a while ago. In contrast, the use of the \textsc{absolute completive} in \REF{bwaa3b} hints at the fact that he has only woken up recently.

Gloss (with missing item): so emptyset1.PN say-R COMP 1SG.PST1 ___ 2SG.OBJ cut le5-speech today COMP 1SG-PRS stay-R eat N1-child 1-POSS.2SG
The English translation of this sentence is:`So Nzambi says, ``I have cut your word today [I'm not listening to you]; I stay and eat your child''.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given that the \textsc{perfect} can occur in both \textsc{past 1} and \textsc{past 2} tense-mood categories, i.e.\ temporal distance between situation and speech time can be manipulated, a relatively long temporal distance cannot be the only information that the \textsc{perfect} encodes. Also, there are examples such as \REF{bwaa4}, where speech time and the situation are more proximate.

Sentence (with missing item): a ___ lìí bâ
Gloss (with missing item): 1.PST1 ___ not.yet marry
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is not yet married.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{pale2a}, the sentential modifier {\itshape lìí} `not yet' (\sectref{sec:SentMod}) is used, which can only occur in negated clauses. In the positive counterpart in \REF{pale2b}, this sentential modifier cannot occur.

Sentence (with missing item): mɛ ___ H-be-lɔ̀lɔ
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.PST ___ OBJ.LINK-be8-duck
The English translation of this sentence is:`I cooked ducks.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Negation with {\itshape sàlɛ́/pálɛ́} is asymmetric with regards to its positive counterpart in several respects. First, there is a constructional asymmetry in terms of the predicate structure. The positive clause in \REF{pale3a} is a simple predicate construction in which the lexical verb is tonally inflected for the realis mood. In contrast, the negated counterpart with the auxiliary {\itshape sàlɛ́} in \REF{pale3b} is a complex predicate in which finiteness marking occurs on the auxiliary and not on the lexical verb.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ kálɛ̀ ná bɛ̀ nà jí ɛ́ vâ
Gloss (with missing item): ___ NEG.FUT still be COM emptyset7.place LOC here
The English translation of this sentence is:`I won't have a place here anymore.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \textsc{Future} negation with {\itshape kálɛ̀} is asymmetric in the same ways that are described for negation with \textsc{past} {\itshape sàlɛ́/pálɛ́}. There is a constructional asymmetry between simple predicates in positive and complex predicates in negative \textsc{future}. In contrast to the \textsc{past} tenses, however, the \textsc{future} belongs to the irrealis mood, which lacks the realis-marking H tone on the finite verb. Despite the absence of the grammatical tone, it is clear from the position of the adverb {\itshape ná} `still' that {\itshape kálɛ̀} in \REF{kale1a} is the finite verb, while {\itshape bɛ̀ nà} in \REF{kale1b} is finite. The adverb always occurs after the finite verb (\sectref{sec:CompPred}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`[depiction of disease roaming in his body] He was about to be sick, not wanting to die.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A common use of the negation auxiliary {\itshape the morpheme ___} concerns the negation of infinitives. It is characteristic of these constructions that the negated lexical verb appears in its non-finite form, i.e.\ without tense-mood or realis H tone marking. Furthermore, the auxiliary {\itshape the morpheme ___} is not preceded by a \textsc{stamp} marker in these constructions, as \REF{its gloss ___inf1} and \REF{its gloss ___inf2} show.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I drink coffee without (having) sugar.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This negative infinitival construction with {\itshape bɛ̀ nà} `be with' is likely the source of the prepositional use of {\itshape the morpheme ___} (\sectref{sec:PREP}). As \REF{its gloss ___inf1x} shows, {\itshape bɛ̀ nà} `be with' can also be elided, only leaving {\itshape the morpheme ___} as the preposition `without'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I drink coffee without (having) sugar.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This negative infinitival construction with {\itshape bɛ̀ the morpheme ___} `be with' is likely the source of the prepositional use of {\itshape tí} (\sectref{sec:PREP}). As \REF{NEGinf1x} shows, {\itshape bɛ̀ the morpheme ___} `be with' can also be elided, only leaving {\itshape tí} as the preposition `without'.

Sentence (with missing item): mɛ ___ dè
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ eat
The English translation of this sentence is:`I don't EAT.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: {\itshape the morpheme ___} can also be used for negation in a \textsc{present} main clause, as shown in \REF{tilea}. This contrasts with the general \textsc{present} negation with the suffix -{\itshape lɛ} in \REF{tileb} (\sectref{sec:its gloss ___PRES}).

Sentence (with missing item): mɛ ___ ná dè
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ still eat
The English translation of this sentence is:`I don't EAT anymore.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Impressionistically, it seems that {\itshape the morpheme ___} in main clauses is often used in conjunction with the adverb {\itshape ná} `still', giving a reading of `anymore' under negation. This might be the case because adverbs modify lexical verbs and the lexical verb is focused in \REF{tile2a}. When negation is focused, as in \REF{tile2b}, however, the use of adverbs such as {\itshape ná} `still' is also grammatical.
A: word: tí	 gloss: NEG

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The difference between {\itshape the morpheme ___} and {\itshape the morpheme ___lɛ̀} in Kwasio might relate to different tense categories, as in \REF{ti5}, in which {\itshape the morpheme ___} is located in the past, whereas {\itshape the morpheme ___lɛ̀} in \REF{ti6} encodes the present. If this is the case,\footnote{There is very little information on Kwasio, and \posscitet{woungly71} description of negation in Ngumba does not give a concise account of the different functions of {\itshape ki} or {\itshape kile}, but it seems that, as in Gyeli, both negation markers are found in different tense categories.} the Kwasio negation auxiliaries might encode different tense categories than Gyeli {\itshape tí}: if {\itshape the morpheme ___} only substituted the form {\itshape tí} in \REF{ti5}, the tense reading should be present.

Sentence (with missing item): nà wɛ ___ wɔ̀mbɛlɛ
Gloss (with missing item): Q 2SG.PST1 ___ sweep
The English translation of this sentence is:`Have you finished sweeping?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The semi-auxiliary {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' is used aspectually in complex predicates with a \textsc{non-complete accomplishment} ({\NCA}) reading.\footnote{Special thanks to Hana Filip for her advice on aspect category meaning and terminology.} As explained in \sectref{sec:COMPL}, {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' implies that somebody has ceased to do an activity, without entailing that the activity has been carried out to completion (unlike the \textsc{absolute completive} {\itshape mɔ̀}). Thus, the question in \REF{silea} is interpreted as concerning whether the addressee is done sweeping, but not whether he or she has swept everything (the whole house or yard).
A: word: sílɛ-h	 gloss: finish-R

The English translation of this sentence is:`I'm taking down [palm trees] one by one, I start to drink [them] up [make palm wine out of them].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Besides this non-complete accomplishment implication, one of the core functions of {\itshape the morpheme ___̀} is to express distributivity of an event or kind. The description of palm wine in \REF{sile1},\footnote{The occurrence of semi-auxiliaries as finite or non-finite verbs in complex predicates is addressed in \sectref{sec:ComplMulti}.} for example, involves many episodes of `drinking a palm tree', namely coming back every day and harvesting the wine. This does not mean that there is not a drop of sap left in the palm trees at the end, but that the speaker will keep harvesting palm wine from the trees until he is done with these multiple actions. The same is true for \REF{silea}, where the event of sweeping is composed of many episodes of moving the broom over the ground.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although {\itshape pã̂} is consistently translated into French as {\itshape d'abord} `first', I gloss it as `do first', as it is clearly a semi-auxiliary verb (\sectref{sec:AUX}). {\itshape pã̂} `do first' has a priorative aspectual meaning. It has no tense-mood restrictions, however, in the corpus, {\itshape pã̂} never occurs in \textsc{past} tenses. This may have semantic/pragmatic reasons.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although {\itshape pã̂} is consistently translated into French as {\itshape d'abord} `first', I gloss it as `do first', as it is clearly a semi-auxiliary verb (\sectref{sec:AUX}). {\itshape pã̂} `do first' has a priorative aspectual meaning. It has no tense-mood restrictions, however, in the corpus, {\itshape pã̂} never occurs in \textsc{past} tenses. This may have semantic/pragmatic reasons. Examples for {\itshape pã̂} in the \textsc{present} are given in \REF{pa1} and \REF{pan1}.
