The sentence-final element the morpheme ___n functions as a channel checker, i.e. ‘have you heard what I’ve just said?’ and thereby solicits a preferably affirmative response. The example also shows that interjections are set off from the rest of the utterance by a prosodic break (indicated by the comma).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Pichi also features expressive “secondary interjections” (\citealt[176]{Bloomfield1935}; \citealt{Ameka1992a}) which function as members of other word class\is{word classes}es besides their use as deictic-pragmatic elements.
