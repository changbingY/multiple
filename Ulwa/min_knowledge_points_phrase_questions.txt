Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As discussed in \sectref{sec:7.1} and \sectref{sec:7.2}, \isi{subject marker}s and \isi{object marker}s do not always occur in NPs that function as subjects or as objects. When they do occur, however, they mark their respective NPs for \isi{number}. The three \isi{number} categories in Ulwa are \isi{singular}, \isi{dual}, and \isi{plural} (\sectref{sec:7.1}--\sectref{sec:7.3}). Whereas the category of \isi{dual} is never employed when there are three or more referents, the category of \isi{plural} is sometimes found even when there are exactly two referents, as in \REF{ex:phrase:5}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: See \sectref{sec:11.4.2} for other \isi{case}-like uses of the \isi{oblique marker}. It may be noted here that there is some overlap in function between the \isi{oblique marker} and the possessive marker. Just as the \isi{oblique marker} =n \textsc{‘obl'} can function very much like a possessive marker, \isi{possessive pronoun}s marked with -nji \textsc{‘poss'} can serve \isi{oblique}-like functions -- namely, they may indicate a beneficiary, as in sentences \REF{ex:phrase:21}, \REF{ex:phrase:22}, and \REF{ex:phrase:23}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Thus, wana- ‘feel’ can function either as an \isi{intransitive} verb introducing a clausal complement \REF{ex:phrase:45} or as a \isi{transitive} verb, as in \REF{ex:phrase:46} and \REF{ex:phrase:47}. The form wana- ‘feel’, however, can combine with a nominal element to create a new meaning. For example, sentence \REF{ex:phrase:48} illustrates the noun-plus-verb \isi{compound} nambïtwana- ‘smell’, which here takes as its \isi{direct object} the \isi{pronoun} nï= ‘1\textsc{sg}’.\footnote{The \isi{compound} nambïtwana- ‘smell (\isi{transitive})’ consists of nambït ‘odor’ and wana- ‘sense’ (i.e., ‘sense odor’).}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This section covers a small subclass of \isi{separable verb}s involving words with meanings somewhat like \ili{English} put.

Indeed, they may even be able to function \isi{intransitive}ly as well. Second, the object of these Ulwa verbs is not a \isi{theme} argument, but rather a goal, the place to which a \isi{theme} is put. If a \isi{theme} argument is expressed in a clause, it occurs in an \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}. One such verb is u- ‘put’, which, as in \REF{ex:phrase:73} and \REF{ex:phrase:74}, takes a \isi{goal} as its object argument.

Question 109:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ulum tamndï ma-awa ___
Gloss (with missing item): palm owner 3SG.OBJ-INT ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`The owner of the sago palms herself will wring them.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are some other verbs that appear on \isi{morphological} grounds to belong to this class of separable ‘put’ verbs, but which never seem to occur as \isi{discontinuous} elements. This could simply be due to their \isi{semantics}. For example, the object of a verb such as mïmïlu- ‘wring, strain’ is more likely to be a \isi{theme} argument than a \isi{goal} argument. This verb may be seen in sentences \REF{ex:phrase:86} and \REF{ex:phrase:87}.\footnote{The fact that ‘put’ verbs can, however, so commonly permit separable constructions has a certain rationale to it, especially considering that the object of these verbs glossed as ‘put’ is always the \isi{goal} and not the \isi{theme}, which, when overt, is expressed as an \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}. Thus, in expressions like ‘send to a place’ or ‘gather/pile up to a place’, it is appropriate that the object of the second element in the \isi{separable verb} (i.e., the ‘put’ verb) is a destination.}
