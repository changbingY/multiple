Other Kalamang question words cannot be used as placeholders. Placeholder neba occurs at a frequency of around six per 1000 words in the natural spoken Kalamang corpus. It can replace only nouns and verbs. Although placeholder neba is nominal in origin, both NP and predicate morphology can attach directly to the root. Most NP and predicate morphology is attested on placeholder neba in the current corpus, and all morphology attested on placeholder neba is found on nouns and verbs. Neba always carries all morphology that the replaced verb or noun would have carried. Neba does not have another distribution than the verbs and nouns it replaces: it occurs in the same slot. The following examples show some of the uses of this placeholder. In~(\ref{exe:parpas}), neba stands in for a possessed object, and is inflected with the third-person possessive marker -un and object marker\is{postposition!object} =at.

Gloss (with missing item): make hot aubergine=too aubergine then beans ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Make [the dish] hot, aubergine too, aubergine, then beans, and with whatsit.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: These examples show that sometimes, the speaker retrieves the target and utters it after the placeholder (this happens for example after the utterance in~\ref{exe:torime}). When the speaker does not do so, this is either because they fail to retrieve the target or because the target is not deemed important enough to be retrieved. There are no recorded uses of placeholder neba that deliberately obscure the target because it is taboo or inappropriate. Neba may be used as a generic expression. In~(\ref{exe:tink}), the speaker describes a wooden toy construction. The speaker has never seen this toy (Tinkertoy) before, so there is no convention as to what to call the different construction parts. He describes some of the parts with neba, and leaves it to the addressee to identify the correct referent. In this context, it is not necessary to find a specific noun to describe all parts of the toy construction, because the addressee can deduce from other information (such as the location and numeral in~\ref{exe:tink}) which parts the speaker intends.
A: word: neba=bon=et	 gloss: PH=COM=IRR
B: word: neba=bon=a	 gloss: what=COM=FOC
C: word: neba=et	 gloss: PH=IRR
D: word: neba-un=at	 gloss: PH-3POSS=OBJ

Sentence (with missing item): wat ___ mindi kajie
Gloss (with missing item): coconut ___ like_that pick
The English translation of this sentence is:`We picked up I-don't-know-how-many coconuts like that.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The question word\is{question word} puraman `how many' is used as a placeholder for \is{quantifier}quantifiers and as a generic quantifier. As a generic quantifier, it refers to a large-ish number, the exact amount of which the speaker does not know or does not feel the need to convey. In~(\ref{exe:watnakk}), puraman is used to convey that there were many coconuts, so many that the speaker doesn't know the exact amount. In~(\ref{exe:yuolp}), it is used to indicate that several days had passed, but that the speaker doesn't know exactly how many. (\ref{exe:nasuarikm}) is a genuine placeholder, which is used to fill the slot of the quantifier until the target (`three') is found. When puraman `how many' is used as a placeholder, it carries the same inflection as the quantifier it replaces, and occurs in the same slot. Note, however, that although the numeral in~(\ref{exe:nasuarikm}) is suffixed to the pronoun mu, puraman is not.
A: word: nak-puraman-i	 gloss: CLF_FRUIT1-how_many-OBJQNT
B: word: taraman-kodak	 gloss: fathom-just_one
C: word: tep-eir	 gloss: CLF_FRUIT2-two

Gloss (with missing item): EMPH 2SG ___ PROX=OBJ=FOC consume=so so_that thing rotten=AT like_this=IRR 2SG can eat=NFIN
The English translation of this sentence is:`Oh, you eat this stuff, so that [this means] you can eat rotten stuff like this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Don `its gloss ___' is a generic noun that is used as a nominal placeholder that deliberately obscures the target. This is the morpheme ___e for one of three reasons: to make a polite version of a word, to express disdain or to make generic reference. Don `its gloss ___' is thus not, in contrast to placeholder neba, used when the speaker has trouble retrieving the target. Examples of polite versions of words are given in~(\ref{exe:lamp}). These are used when the regular version is inappropriate: for example, when begging someone else for these goods (which may be scarce), or when communicating with someone in your household about the lack of these items in front of a guest.\footnote{Such obscured or polite forms may also be made in other ways. Another obscured/polite word for sugar or rice is muap iriskap, lit. `white food', and another obscured/polite word for pitis `money' is lolok `leaf'.} In~(\ref{exe:narathe morpheme ___}), instead of saying sor `fish', the narrator uses derogatory the morpheme ___ to express his disdain towards the fact that a crow has eaten rotten fish. (\ref{exe:the morpheme ___nab}) illustrates the generic use of the morpheme ___; it is incorporated in the verb nabaca `to read'. Don `its gloss ___' is the only object noun that always incorporates (§\ref{sec:incorp}). Don `its gloss ___' can be used in combination with kon `one' as an indefinite pronoun (for examples, see §\ref{sec:quantinfl}).
