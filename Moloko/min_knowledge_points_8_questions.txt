Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \largerpage \citet{FriesenMamalis2008} discovered that pivotal events at the high points in a narrative\is{Focus and prominence!Discourse peak} may be coded with a particular verb phrase construction in which an ideophone or the uninflected stem form of a verb is followed by the main verb in its nominalised form (\ref{ex:8:35}--\ref{ex:8:37}, see \sectref{sec:7.6.2}). In the stem plus verb construction, the stem and main verb are normally formed from the same verb root. Note that it is the stem that is used in the construction (not the root) since the /-j/ suffix is present \REF{ex:8:37}. Neither the main verb nor the auxiliary is inflected for subject, and the clause often has no noun phrase to indicate subject (\ref{ex:8:35}, \ref{ex:8:38}--\ref{ex:8:40}, \ref{ex:8:44}). When a subject noun phrase is present, it can only be a full free pronoun (\ref{ex:8:36}--\ref{ex:8:37}, \ref{ex:8:41}-- \ref{ex:8:43}, \ref{ex:8:45}). The main verb can have direct and indirect object pronominals and other extensions (\ref{ex:8:36} and \ref{ex:8:37}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \largerpage \citet{FriesenMamalis2008} discovered that pivotal events at the high points in a narrative\is{Focus and prominence!Discourse peak} may be coded with a particular verb phrase construction in which an ideophone or the uninflected stem form of a verb is followed by the main verb in its nominalised form (\ref{ex:8:35}--\ref{ex:8:37}, see \sectref{sec:7.6.2}). In the stem plus verb construction, the stem and main verb are normally formed from the same verb root. Note that it is the stem that is used in the construction (not the root) since the /-j/ suffix is present \REF{ex:8:37}. Neither the main verb nor the auxiliary is inflected for subject, and the clause often has no noun phrase to indicate subject (\ref{ex:8:35}, \ref{ex:8:38}--\ref{ex:8:40}, \ref{ex:8:44}). When a subject noun phrase is present, it can only be a full free pronoun (\ref{ex:8:36}--\ref{ex:8:37}, \ref{ex:8:41}-- \ref{ex:8:43}, \ref{ex:8:45}). The main verb can have direct and indirect object pronominals and other extensions (\ref{ex:8:36} and \ref{ex:8:37}). In the following examples, the verb phrase is delimited by square brackets and the verb stem plus ideophone are bolded.
A: word: ŋgax	 gloss: hide
B: word: aŋga	 gloss: POSS
C: word: ma-ŋgəh=ata=aka=va	 gloss: NOM-hide=3P.IO=on=PRF

Sentence (with missing item): ___ mɪ-bɛh-ɛ kə vɛr aka aɮa]
Gloss (with missing item): ___ NOM-pour-CL on stone on now
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[She] poured [the grains of millet] on the grinding stone.’ (lit. pour, pouring on the grinding stone now)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Because the subject, direct object, and indirect object are optional for this construction, the construction can be used in Moloko discourse as a narrative device to reduce the number of explicit grammatical relations in a clause (cf. Sections~\ref{sec:3.6.3} and \ref{sec:9.4}). The participants become indefinite in the construction and must be inferred from the context. The effect is to draw the hearer into the action of the moment. In \REF{ex:8:35}, \REF{ex:8:39}, and \REF{ex:8:40}, \is{Transitivity!Clauses with zero transitivity|(}the construction is completely non-inflected for subject and has zero grammatical relations\is{Transitivity!Clauses with zero transitivity}. The narrative effect is that in \REF{ex:8:35} and \REF{ex:8:39}, the hearer only knows that someone is its gloss ___ing something onto the grinding stone. In \REF{ex:8:40}, it is as if the hearer is with the husband, looking into the house to find the woman. Likewise, in \REF{ex:8:44}, the verb mələye ‘bury’ is non-conjugated for subject, making those who buried the dead woman ‘out of sight’ in the narrative.
