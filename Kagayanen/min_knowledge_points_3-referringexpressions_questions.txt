The English translation of this sentence is:‘When what was cooked is already cooked (completely) they gather together and eat.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The nominalizing infix <in> occurs after the first consonant of the root.\footnote{As discussed in Chapter 2, in Kagayanen all words begin with consonants. Words that begin with vowel letters in the orthography actually start with an unwritten glottal stop, which is a full consonant in Kagayanen. So, for example, the verb ambaļ has an initial unwritten glottal stop. The infix <in> occurs after the initial glottal stop to form the word spelled inambaļ.} The resulting noun usually refers to something that is affected by the action or process described by the root (examples \ref{bkm:Ref419299508} and \ref{bkm:Ref419299510}). In this sense, <in> is analogous to a past-participle marker. Unlike \isi{Tagalog} and many other Philippine languages, <in> alone has no function as a Transitivity/Modality marker on inflected verbs. Rather, in Kagayanen the corresponding \isi{inflectional} form is the transitive realis pa{}- (see \chapref{chap:verbstructure}, \sectref{sec:transitiverealis}):
A: word: s<in>in-ad	 gloss: <NR.RES>cook.grain
B: word: s<in>inugba	 gloss: <NR.RES>roast
C: word: sin-ad	 gloss: cook.grain
D: word: pag-ka-sellem	 gloss: NR.ACT-NR-morning

Gloss (with missing item): NR.ACT-arrive 1P.EXCL.GEN D4LOC quickly 1P.EXCL.ABS again.as.before eat because EXT.IN PL ___ LK fish
The English translation of this sentence is:`When we arrived there, quickly we ate again because there were some roasted fish.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like all Kagayanen nouns, nominalizations formed with the infix <in> can function as modifiers (as in \ref{bkm:Ref419299508}). For example, baļad ‘to sun dry’ with <in> becomes binaļad ‘sun dried thing’. This form may occur in the position of a modifier in Referring Phrases, e.g., binaļad na mais ‘sun dried corn’. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref419378020} and \REF{bkm:Ref51233639} are corpus examples illustrating this usage with the roots sugba ‘to roast’ and begkes ‘to bundle’ respectively:
A: word: s<in>inugba	 gloss: <NR.RES>roast

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like all Kagayanen nouns, nominalizations formed with the infix <in> can function as modifiers (as in \ref{bkm:Ref419299508}).

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1S.GEN DEF.F LK child A.HAP.R-fall NABS stairs
The English translation of this sentence is:`The child I cared for fell down the stairs.’ (lit. `my cared for child')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The infix <in> may combine with the applicative \textit{{}-an}. Only verb roots which require or allow the applicative \nobreakdash-an may be nominalized in this way (see \chapref{chap:stemformingprocesses}, \sectref{sec:applicative-an}). The interpretation of the resulting nominalization depends largely on the nature of the verb root, and is generally consistent with the use of the applicative suffix on Inflected Verbs. For example, as discussed in \chapref{chap:stemformingprocesses}, \sectref{sec:applicative-an}, some transitive verbs require \textit{{}-an} in their normal active-transitive use as main verbs. For this same set of roots, <in>...-an forms a nominalization that refers to the Patient of the verb (\ref{bkm:Ref419300230}-\ref{bkm:Ref419300233}). The stress on such nominalizations is regular---the main stress falls on the penultimate syllable and the secondary stress two syllables to the left.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘His/her chopped wood another person took (it).’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some roots can take either <in> alone or <in>...-an to form a Patient nominalization (\ref{bkm:Ref419300396} and \ref{bkm:Ref447637695}). With <in> alone the patient is presented as more precise and individuated and in some situations is more directly acted upon than the corresponding form with <in>...-an. This meaning difference is comparable to the difference between pa- and pa-…-an for this same class of roots used as inflected verbs (see \chapref{chap:verbstructure}, \sectref{bkm:Ref448124627}).

You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore.

Sentence (with missing item): Yi na ___ ko na mga bata kan-o, ga-tudlo man anduni.
Gloss (with missing item): D1ABS LK ___ 1S.GEN LK PL child previously I.R-teach also now/today
The English translation of this sentence is:`These children I taught previously, are teaching also now.’ (lit. ‘My taught children ...”)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref419380070}, <in> with the verb tudlo ‘teach’ becomes tinudlo referring to what is being taught, which in this example is a dance.

The English translation of this sentence is:`After it became morning again as before, we left again going to a restaurant.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \footnotetext{There are two words glossed as ‘again’ in this example. Eman is the marked member of the pair, and refers to the continuation of an action that was interrupted. Isab expresses no particular sense of continuation. In the context of example \REF{bkm:Ref447656201}, eman would have been semantically appropriate in both positions, however we speculate that having two emans in a row would have sounded odd, so the speaker chose to use isab in the second instance, which is also semantically appropriate.}
A: word: pag-ka-sellem	 gloss: NR.ACT-NR-morning
B: word: ka-selled	 gloss: I.EXM-go.inside
C: word: pag-kita	 gloss: NR.ACT-see

The English translation of this sentence is:`One day, the two friends, Hermit Crab and Sea Turtle, went strolling on the beach.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The affix mag{}- with nouns that indicate a human relationship, such as kinship terms and words such as arey ‘friend’, result in a noun that refers to particular persons who are in that relationship. Some of these nouns express reciprocal and others non-reciprocal relationships. For example, mag{}- with utod ‘sibling’ becomes mag-utod ‘siblings (to each other)’ (\ref{bkm:Ref420509881}); mag- with arey ‘friend’ becomes mag-arey meaning ‘friends (to each other)’, (\ref{bkm:Ref420509947}). These are reciprocal relationships, since each member of the relationship is equal---sibling-to-sibling, or friend-to-friend. An example of a non-reciprocal relationship is mag{}- + inay ‘mother’ yielding mag-inay ‘mother and child(ren)’:
A: word: mag--arey	 gloss: REL-friend
B: word: mag--ambaļ-anay	 gloss: I.IR-say-REC
C: word: arey	 gloss: friend
D: word: papa	 gloss: Papa

The English translation of this sentence is:`The music the band played was the older people’s style of music of long ago.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The prefix king- is added to a nominal root to form a new noun that refers to the ‘style’ or ‘manner’ of the root noun. This is not a common prefix. Example \REF{bkm:Ref116461310} below is the only instance of this prefix in the corpus. The others are all from conversation, or are elicited. Words formed with king- are not adjectives by the definition given in \chapref{chap:modification}, \sectref{sec:adjectives}, because they do not occur with degree adverbs such as sikad ‘very’:
A: word: king-manakem	 gloss: style/way-older
B: word: manakem	 gloss: older

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he gave his/her viand to me.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \footnotetext{The root for this verb is atag. In conversation, the initial vowel normally drops out when a suffix occurs, though this is optional. In example \REF{bkm:Ref420429206}, below, the initial vowel may not drop out because the verb carries no suffix.}

A: word: yaken	 gloss: 1S.ABS
