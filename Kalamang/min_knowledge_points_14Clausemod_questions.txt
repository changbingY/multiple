Sentence (with missing item): et=at ___ me isetengamati
Gloss (with missing item): canoe=OBJ ___ TOP big_effort
The English translation of this sentence is:`[Before], if you wanted to anchor your boat, it was very difficult.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \is{conditional}Conditional clauses also make use of irrealis =et on the predicate expressing the condition. They are treated in §\ref{sec:condclause}. Note that volitional =kin, treated in §\ref{sec:kin}, combines with irrealis =et if it is used in its conditional sense, as in~(\ref{exe:saor}). The volitional marker always precedes the irrealis marker.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Conditional mood is made with conditional clitic =o or =ero, which attaches to the predicate with the condition.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Watch out, there is a snake under the chair, it might bite you.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Apprehensive mood, used when the speaker wishes to express fear that something bad will happen, is done with an apprehensive clitic =re, which is attached to the subject or object NP of the clause. The predicate is marked with irrealis =et (§\ref{sec:et}), and many clauses are preceded by the \is{interjection}interjection jaga `watch out' (a Malay loan). In contrast to precautionary constructions (§\ref{sec:appreh}), only the danger is expressed and not necessarily the precaution to be taken. This morpheme is not found in the natural speech corpus, but was easily elicited with the help of pictures designed by Marine Vuillermet (p.c.) depicting dangerous situations, or by simply asking speakers what they would say in a specific dangerous situation. Examples of pictures were that of a snake under a chair (example~\ref{exe:kipkader}), or a crocodile approaching a human being. An example of a dangerous situation I described is walking on the beach under palm trees bearing ripe coconuts. In that situation, someone might utter~(\ref{exe:watre}). Note that in this example, the suggested precaution to take is also expressed in an imperative clause preceding the apprehensive clause.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Apprehensive mood, used when the speaker wishes to express fear that something bad will happen, is done with an apprehensive clitic =re, which is attached to the subject or object NP of the clause.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Watch out or you'll fall, jump away [from the dock].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the previous examples, the apprehensive morpheme =re is attached to the noun that refers to the danger. In intransitive clauses, the danger is the addressee themselves, because they are behaving irresponsibly. In~(\ref{exe:kire}), the speaker utters an imaginary warning to kids jumping from the dock. If they do not jump far enough away from a dock, they might hit sharp rocks.

The English translation of this sentence is:`That woman, her cousins already ordered him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Kalamang has one aspectual particle, the morpheme ___ `already', and one aspectual word, tok `still; yet; first'. Both follow the subject NP. Se has an allomorph he, which is usually uthe morpheme ___d after vowels (the morpheme ___e §\ref{the morpheme ___c:len}). This is not a watertight rule: one does find the morpheme ___ after vowels and (less commonly) he after consonants. This suggests that the morpheme ___/he is developing into a clitic (which attaches to the subject NP). Becauthe morpheme ___ the form the morpheme ___ or he is not completely predictable from the phonological context, I give both variants as they are found in the corpus examples. I gloss the morpheme ___ `already' as \textsc{iam} for iamitive, which are ``more or less grammaticalithe morpheme ___d markers that have functions shared by `already' and the perfect\is{perfect}'' \parencite[][4]{olsson2013}.

Both follow the subject NP. Se has an allomorph he, which is usually used after vowels (see §\ref{sec:len}). This is not a watertight rule: one does find se after vowels and (less commonly) he after consonants. This suggests that se/he is developing into a clitic (which attaches to the subject NP). Because the form se or he is not completely predictable from the phonological context, I give both variants as they are found in the corpus examples. I gloss se `already' as \textsc{iam} for iamitive, which are ``more or less grammaticalised markers that have functions shared by `already' and the perfect\is{perfect}'' \parencite[][4]{olsson2013}.
