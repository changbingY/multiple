Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Ubra ta ake na amay ___ nang daw ma-kwa ta guso ma-ng-tanem, ma-ng-uma.
Gloss (with missing item): work NABS 1S.GEN LK father ___ only/just and A.HAP.IR-whachamacallit NABS seaweed A.HAP.IR-PL-plant A.HAP.IR-PL-field
The English translation of this sentence is:`The work of my father is to spear fish, to whatchamacallit, to plant agar-agar seaweed, to farm.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb tanem ‘to plant’, as in examples \REF{bkm:Ref447198515} and \REF{bkm:Ref444336178}, often takes the pluraction prefix. This is because planting necessarily involves multiple, repetitive actions. Thus, even if one person is planting, the pluraction prefix may be used (example \ref{bkm:Ref447198515}). A verb may optionally take the pluraction prefix when several actors perform the same intransitive action individually (examples \ref{bkm:Ref444336178} and \ref{bkm:Ref394988295}):
A: word: ma-ng-tampara	 gloss: A.HAP.IR-PL-goggles

The English translation of this sentence is:`The work of my father is to spear fish, to whatchamacallit, to plant agar-agar seaweed, to farm.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since pluractionality is only expressed in grammatically intransitive constructions, it does not occur with the transitive, realis pa{}-. When it occurs with the ambitransitive happenstantial prefixes, na{}- and ma{}-, the construction must be understood as grammatically intransitive (see examples \ref{bkm:Ref447198515} and \ref{bkm:Ref444336178} above).

The English translation of this sentence is:`The next days again, as before, the fish (called) always-debting was able again to make debts.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref394988618} the pluraction prefix is used on the verb utang ‘to borrow money’ because this fish was in the habit of making debts, and in the discourse context he enabled himself to make many debts again by changing his appearance:

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ta nanay din suman an kani.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ NABS mother 3SGEN sticky.rice.cake DEF.M later
The English translation of this sentence is:‘His/her mother will cook the sticky rice cake later.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The stem-forming prefix pa{}- adds a causative sense to any verb root. The result is an inherently transitive stem that can then be inflected with any of the inflectional affixes discussed in \chapref{chap:verbstructure}. Such morphological causatives are discussed from a function-first perspective, along with other types of causatives, in \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:causatives}. Examples \REF{bkm:Ref397062399} and \REF{bkm:Ref444336543} illustrate dynamic non-causative and corresponding causative constructions:
A: word: luto-en	 gloss: cook-T.IR
B: word: pa-luto-en	 gloss: CAUS-cook-T.IR
C: word: ∅-luto-an	 gloss: T.IR-cook-APL

Sentence (with missing item): ___ kanen ta nanay din ta suman kani.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ABS NABS mother 3S.GEN NABS sticky.rice.cake later
The English translation of this sentence is:‘His/her mother will have him/her cook the sticky rice cake later.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \footnotetext{The detransitive (actor voice) construction is often used when an ergative element needs to occur in the absolutive form for purposes of relativization, or, as in this elicited example based on example \REF{bkm:Ref395074775}, when the causer is fronted for contrastive/focal prominence (see \chapref{chap:voice}, \sectref{sec:causatives}).}
A: word: pa-luto-en	 gloss: CAUS-cook-T.IR
B: word: pa-luto	 gloss: T.R-cook
C: word: pa-leddang-en	 gloss: CAUS-sink-T.IR

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ko antibiotic ya.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1S.ERG antibiotics DEF.F
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I took the antibiotics.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the verb forms are identical in examples \REF{bkm:Ref362342951} and \REF{bkm:Ref122954287}, \REF{bkm:Ref122954287} is clearly the causative because of the construction in which it appears. The midwife is the ergative case agent of cause, and the speaker is the absolutive case causee. As a non-causative this would have to mean ‘The midwife took me (as medicine)’, which is pragmatically nonsensical. Furthermore, the verb form papatumar, with both pa{}- prefixes present, may replace the verb in \REF{bkm:Ref122954287} but not in \REF{bkm:Ref362342951}. When both prefixes occur, the effect is to make the causative notion more forceful or more direct. The causer is the one initiating and forcing the causee to perform the action either with words, threats of punishment or physical force. The causee does not have a choice to perform the action or not.
A: word: pa-tumar	 gloss: T.R-take.meds
B: word: pa-tumba	 gloss: T.R-fall.over
C: word: ga-pa-buļong	 gloss: I.R-CAUS-medicine

The English translation of this sentence is:‘I took the antibiotics.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the verb forms are identical in examples \REF{bkm:Ref362342951} and \REF{bkm:Ref122954287}, \REF{bkm:Ref122954287} is clearly the causative because of the construction in which it appears.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Before I make my letter long, I want to first wish you a good day.’ (This is a common way to begin a letter in Kagayanen, literally: ... I cause a good day to reach you.’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: These roots can also occur with the overt causative prefix. Example \REF{bkm:Ref395081078} illustrates the root mļangkaw/ļangkaw with the causative prefix and transitive irrealis suffix:
A: word: pa-ļangkaw-en	 gloss: CAUS-long-T.IR

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 2S.ERG first/for.awhile manioc.flour DEF.M for INST-starch
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Dissolve please the manioc flour for use as starch.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{bkm:Ref395110927} and \REF{bkm:Ref122956811}, this same root is used transitively with transitive irrealis and transitive realis affixation respectively. The effect is a causative interpretation (`cause to dissolve'), even though the causative prefix does not appear.
A: word: tunaw-en	 gloss: dissolve-T.IR

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he dissolved the manioc flour for use as starch.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{bkm:Ref395110927} and \REF{bkm:Ref122956811}, this same root is used transitively with transitive irrealis and transitive realis affixation respectively. The effect is a causative interpretation (`cause to dissolve'), even though the causative prefix does not appear.
A: word: pa-tunaw	 gloss: T.R-dissolve

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he dissolved the manioc flour for use as starch.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are at least two pieces of evidence that show that the pa{}- prefix in example \REF{bkm:Ref122956811} is the transitive, realis pa{}- and not the causative. First, the transitive irrealis form is used in example \REF{bkm:Ref395110927} with the same set of argument roles (Causer-ergative, patient-absolutive). Second, this verb may also take the causative prefix, in which case the effect is an indirect causative of a causative:
A: word: pa-tunaw	 gloss: T.R-dissolve
B: word: pa-tunaw-en	 gloss: CAUS-dissolve-T.IR

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are at least two pieces of evidence that show that the pa{}- prefix in example \REF{bkm:Ref122956811} is the transitive, realis pa{}- and not the causative. First, the transitive irrealis form is used in example \REF{bkm:Ref395110927} with the same set of argument roles (Causer-ergative, patient-absolutive). Second, this verb may also take the causative prefix, in which case the effect is an indirect causative of a causative:

Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ ta sakon Pasig River ya.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ NABS whale Pasig River DEF.F
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The whale happened to wash ashore in the Pasig River.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref395170609}, the Pasig River lacks the non-absolutive prenominal case marker ta. This indicates that it is in the absolutive case. Meanwhile the whale is no longer absolutive, but is now marked with ta. We may say that in this case, the non-absolutive role is ergative. Unfortunately, there is no natural way to reflect the difference in meaning expressed by this “advancement” to absolutive status of a locative participant in the English free translation, literally: `The whale washed-ashore-on the Pasig river,' or `the whale affected the Pasig river by washing ashore,' or `The Pasig river was washed upon by the whale.'

Sentence (with missing item): Ta dason na adlaw ake na lola ___ nay ta patyo.
Gloss (with missing item): NABS next LK day/sun 1S.GEN LK grandmother ___ 1P.EXCL.ERG NABS cemetery
The English translation of this sentence is:`The next day we buried my grandmother in the cemetery.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref395171864}, the inherently transitive verb lebbeng ‘bury’ is used in a grammatically transitive, non-applicative clause with an Actor in the ergative role, Undergoer (patient) in the absolutive role and a location, ta patyo, ‘in the cemetery’, in an oblique role:
A: word: pa-lebbeng	 gloss: T.R-bury

Sentence (with missing item): ___ nay patyo an ta mga patay.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1P.EXCL.ERG cemetery DEF.M NABS PL dead
The English translation of this sentence is:‘We buried the dead in the cemetery.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{bkm:Ref395171866}, the same verb is used with the applicative suffix. In this case the cemetery is the absolutive, while the patient argument, ta mga patay ‘the dead ones’ is in a non-absolutive role. The actor is ergative in both examples:
A: word: pa-lebbeng-an	 gloss: T.R-bury-APL
B: word: pa-lebbeng	 gloss: T.R-bury
C: word: pa-ibit-an	 gloss: T.R-hold-APL

Please only return the letter (A–D).

Question 29:
You are a linguist specializing in Kagayanen. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation.

Sentence (with missing item): Bisan ino na mga ampang-an an ___ danen ta iran na bata.
Gloss (with missing item): any what LK PL play-NR DEF.M ___ 3P.ERG NABS 3P.GEN LK child
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Whatever playthings, they gave (them) to their child.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Ditransitive verbs can also appear in applicative constructions. The effect is to express a recipient or location (depending on the verb) in the absolutive role (see \chapref{chap:voice} on voice). Example \REF{bkm:Ref396506191} illustrates the verb atag ‘give’ in a non-applicative construction, with the recipient, iran na bata ‘their child’, in an oblique role, marked by the prenominal case marker ta:
A: word: pa-atag	 gloss: T.R-give
B: word: pa-atag-an	 gloss: T.R-give-APL
C: word: ga-atag	 gloss: I.R-give
D: word: pa-tumar	 gloss: T.R-take.meds

Sentence (with missing item): ___ din bayo din ya ta bļawan.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG shirt 3S.GEN DEF.F NABS gold
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He partially filled his shirt with gold.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref395171874} illustrates the same verb in an applicative construction. Note, however, that the argument structure is the same. The shirt is still absolutive, and the agent is still ergative:
A: word: pa-panno-an	 gloss: T.R-fill-APL
B: word: na-panno-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-fill-APL
C: word: ga-lambay	 gloss: I.R-pass.by

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG shirt 3S.GEN DEF.F NABS gold
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He was able to partially fill his shirt with gold.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref395206755} illustrates the same construction in the happenstantial mode:
A: word: na-panno-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-fill-APL

Sentence (with missing item): ___ din bayo din ya ta bļawan.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG shirt 3S.GEN DEF.F NABS gold
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He partially filled his shirt with gold.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{bkm:Ref395171874} and \REF{bkm:Ref395206755} illustrate the partitive sense of the applicative with the verb panno ‘fill’, which arguably takes a location (the shirt in this case) as its absolutive argument in the unmarked form. However, the applicative has this effect for many other verbs that are inherently transitive. Consider the following:
A: word: pa-panno-an	 gloss: T.R-fill-APL
B: word: na-panno-an	 gloss: A.HAP.R-fill-APL
C: word: buong	 gloss: shatter

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.ERG <NR.RES>-roast DEF.F LK fish SPAT.DEF NABS dish 1S.GEN
The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he ate the roasted fish in my dish.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{bkm:Ref396998462} illustrates the verb kaan ‘eat’ in its basic transitive argument structure with the agent expressed with an ergative pronoun and the patient, the roasted fish, with no prenominal marker, indicating it is absolutive. Example \REF{ex:inmydish-1} is a standard applicative in which the verb carries the applicative suffix, the roasted fish has been marked as non-absolutive, and the dish is now in the absolutive role. Finally, example \REF{ex:inmydish-2} illustrates the partitive use of the applicative construction. The case frame in \REF{ex:inmydish-2} is the same as in \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}. The only difference in structure is the presence of the applicative suffix. The semantic effect is to assert that only some of the roasted fish was consumed.
A: word: pa-kaan	 gloss: T.R-eat

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he ate the roasted fish in my dish.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: One way of understanding this usage is that, since the applicative has the default function of indicating that the absolutive is a location, recipient or some other non-patient semantic role, the use of the applicative when the absolutive is a patient expresses that it is somehow a less than prototypical patient. One reasonable interpretation of this is that the patient is not completely affected by the action of the verb. Another way of understanding this usage is that \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}b is the applicative of \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}a, while \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}c is the applicative of the detransitive of \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}b, given in \REF{bkm:Ref460337201}:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: One way of understanding this usage is that, since the applicative has the default function of indicating that the absolutive is a location, recipient or some other non-patient semantic role, the use of the applicative when the absolutive is a patient expresses that it is somehow a less than prototypical patient. One reasonable interpretation of this is that the patient is not completely affected by the action of the verb. Another way of understanding this usage is that \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}b is the applicative of \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}a, while \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}c is the applicative of the detransitive of \REF{bkm:Ref396998462}b, given in \REF{bkm:Ref460337201}:
