Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ... karna de tida bisa bicara bahasa, maka Ø pake bahasa orang bisu, ... baru Ø Ø foto, foto, a, ___ snang, prempuang bawa babi, Ø kasi Ø Ø
Gloss (with missing item): ... because 3SG NEG be.able speak language therefore ... use language person be.mute ... and.then ... ... photograph photographah! ... ___ (.about) woman bring pig ... give ... ...
The English translation of this sentence is:[First outside contact between a Papuan group living in the jungle and a group of pastors:] `[but they can’t speak Indonesian,] because she can’t speak Indonesian, therefore (she) uses sign language ... (the pastor is taking) pictures, pictures, ah, (the women are) happy, the women bring a pig, (they) give (it to the pastors)’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In concluding this discussion about the \ili{creole} versus non-\ili{creole} status of Papuan Malay, the author agrees with those scholars who challenge the view that the \ili{eastern Malay varieties} are creolized languages. Moreover, the author agrees with \citet[35, 43]{Bisang.2009}, who argues that complexity is not limited to the \isi{morphology} or syntax of a language. Instead, complexity may instead be found in the pragmatic inferential system as applied to utterances in their discourse setting. Such ``hidden complexity'' is certainly a pertinent trait of Papuan Malay, as shown throughout this book. Two examples of hidden complexity are presented in (\ref{Example_1.1}) and (\ref{Example_1.2}). Due to the lack of morphosyntactic marking in Papuan Malay, a given construction can receive different readings, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_1.1}). Depending on the context, the \textitbf{kalo {\ldots} suda} ‘when/if {\ldots} already’ construction can receive a temporal or a counterfactual reading.\footnote{One anonymous reviewer suggests an alternative analysis for the example in (\ref{Example_1.1}). Rather than being ambiguous and exemplifying a case of ``hidden complexity'', the \textitbf{kalo {\ldots} suda} `when/if {\ldots} already' construction expresses an unspecified reason-consequence relation, with the context supplying the information on whether the reason has place.} Example (\ref{Example_1.2}) illustrates the pervasive use of \isi{elision} in Papuan Malay. Verbs allow but do not require core arguments. Therefore, core arguments are readily elided when they are understood from the context ( ``Ø'' represents the omitted arguments).
A: word: ø	 gloss: feel.happy
B: word: pen–jaga	 gloss: AG–guard
C: word: garo~garo	 gloss: RDP~scratch
D: word: putar	 gloss: turn.around
Please only return the letter (A–D).
