The English translation of this sentence is:‘No, he isn’t going to the market; rather he is staying at home (or going to the chief’s house).’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most frequently, it seems that the element closest to the negative that is under the scope of negation, even though a clause-final negative marker can have scope over the whole verb phrase or even over the entire clause. To negate only one constituent in a clause, the clause is sometimes rearranged so that the constituent that is negated is placed in the clause-final position adjacent to the negation particle. Examples (\ref{ex:10:44}--\ref{ex:10:46}) show a question \REF{ex:10:44} with two responses (\ref{ex:10:45}--\ref{ex:10:46}) where each of the two ambiguous elements is negated. The subject (Mana) is part of the presupposition (marked off by na in the question, see \sectref{sec:11.2}). In \REF{ex:10:45} the oblique is negated and in \REF{ex:10:46} the entire predicate. The clauses were not restructured since the elements in question were already clause-final. In the following examples, the element that is negated is delimited by square brackets and the negative is bolded.
A: word: baj	 gloss: NEG
B: word: asa-baj	 gloss: again-NEG

Question 18:
You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Sentence (with missing item): ɛhɛ à-vəl=aŋ [kɪndɛw] ___ à-vəl=aŋ tʃɛtʃœkʷ
Gloss (with missing item): no 3S+PFV-give=3S.IO guitar ___ 3S+PFV-give=3S.IO flute
The English translation of this sentence is:‘No, he didn’t give a guitar to his father, he gave him a flute.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples (\ref{ex:10:47}--\ref{ex:10:50}) show some restructuring when different constituents are negated. Example \REF{ex:10:47} illustrates a question and \REF{ex:10:48} to \REF{ex:10:50} illustrate three possible answers, each negating a different constituent. Normal SVO structure is maintained for all answers. The responses each use two clauses. The first clause expresses the negation of the element in final position, and the second restates the clause giving the corrected information. In each case the first clause is restructured so as to move the element to be negated to the clause-final position. The response in \REF{ex:10:48} indicates that the hearer accepts 'that Mana gave the guitar to someone,' but it was not his father. In this clause, kəndew ‘guitar’ is realised as the \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} \DO pronominal. The response in \REF{ex:10:49} indicates 'that Mana gave something to his father,' but not a guitar. In this case, the adpositional phrase ana baba ahan ‘to his father’ is replaced by the indirect object pronominal so that the negated element kəndew ‘guitar’ can be placed next to the negative.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The first clause structure that is employed is the verbal clause structure (SVO), but with substitution of a question word. The verbal clause structure is rearranged in the same manner as for constituent negation (see \sectref{sec:10.2.3}) in order to position the questioned element in the clause-final position so that it is replaced by the interrogative pronoun. Information questions in verbal clauses are paired with a response in (\ref{ex:10:53}--\ref{ex:10:65}) so that the structure of the interrogative clause can be compared with that of the declarative. Examples in this section are given in pairs. The first example in the pair shows the interrogative construction. The second example is the clause with the information filled in for comparison.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Mala gave what to his brother?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The third structure for content information questions uses a right-shifted na{}-marked element (see \sectref{sec:11.3}). This structure is employed in cases where it is impossible for a questioned verb phrase element to be clause-final. In \REF{ex:10:79}, the direct object is questioned. In this case the direct object cannot be clause-final since it is necessary to include the information ana məlama ahan ‘to his brother,’ and the prepositional phrase must follow the direct object in the verb phrase (\chapref{chap:8}). Thus in the interrogative structure, the interrogative pronoun replaces the direct object and the rest of the clause is put into a post-posed na{}-marked phrase (underlined in this example). A possible response is shown in \REF{ex:10:80}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Yes/no questions are interrogative clauses which can be answered by a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – they are not asking for content in the reply. Moloko uses the interrogative marker the morpheme ___ at the end of what is otherwise a declarative clause to create yes/no interrogatives. Pure yes-no questions can be answered with either yes or no, but in Moloko there is often a degree of expectation to the question.\footnote{Expectation is a central element in understanding Moloko grammar (see \sectref{sec:7.4.3}), as is what constitutes shared information with the hearer (see \chapref{chap:11}). Questions are constructed in Moloko with that knowledge and expectation in mind, even when seeking new information. Tag questions are discussed in \sectref{sec:10.3.3}.} When a speaker asks a yes/no question (\ref{ex:10:81}–\ref{ex:10:83}), they are usually expecting an affirmative reply.

Sentence (with missing item): mɪʒɛ=ahaj ta-g=aw ɛlɛ lala baj ___
Gloss (with missing item): person=Pl 3P-do=oneS.IO thing good NEG ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The people had no reason to do this bad thing to me.’ (lit. the people did the bad thing to me why?)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In a rhetorical question, the speaker is not pragmatically asking for information. Rather, the questions can be evaluative, may carry an element of reproach, or may be a mild command. The context gives the rhetorical force. Some rhetorical questions have a special emphatic structure (see \sectref{sec:10.3.5}) but many have the normal interrogative structure for a content question (\ref{ex:10:95}–\ref{ex:10:96}, see \sectref{sec:10.3.1}). For example, the speaker is not seeking an explanation when he asks kamay ‘its gloss ___’ in \REF{ex:10:95}. More probably he is making a strong statement, ‘the people had no reason to do this bad thing to me.’ Likewise in \REF{ex:10:96}, the speaker is saying that the listener will listen to no one.
