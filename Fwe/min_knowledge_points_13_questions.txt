Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ma-yíː a-bor-é̲te
Gloss (with missing item): ___ NP6-egg SM6-rot-STAT
The English translation of this sentence is:‘These eggs, they’re rotten.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Constituents can be moved out of their canonical position to the beginning of the clause, in which case they are morphologically and prosodically marked as a separate phrase. The prosodic marking of left dislocation is most clearly seen by the application of phrase-final tonal processes, namely the realization of underlying high tones as falling and the shift of final high tones to the penultimate mora (see \sectref{bkm:Ref445214894} on tonal processes), for instance, the final falling tone in the dislocated subject constituent in (\ref{bkm:Ref505778244}). The morphological marking of left dislocation is only seen on dislocated constituents that function as an object or locative adjunct, in which case the dislocated constituent needs to be cross-referenced by an object marker, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref505778246}), or locative clitic, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref505778247}).

Whereas left-dislocated constituents are always followed by a prosodic boundary, a prosodic boundary preceding the right-dislocated constituent is optional. Examples of right-dislocated constituents that do function as a separate phrase are given in (\ref{bkm:Ref491438233}--\ref{bkm:Ref449630026}), as seen from the application of phrase-final tonal processes on the verb preceding the dislocated constituent. An example of a right-dislocated constituent which is not preceded by a prosodic boundary is given in (\ref{bkm:Ref492136669}), as seen from the lack of high tone retraction on the verb preceding the dislocated constituent.
