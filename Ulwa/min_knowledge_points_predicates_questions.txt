Gloss (with missing item): snake 3PL jungle ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`There are snakes in the jungle.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distinction between \isi{locative predication} and \isi{existential predication} is often not clear in Ulwa, since there are no formal distinctions between the two constructions. Like \isi{locative predication}, \isi{existential predication} can be expressed with the \isi{locative verb} p- ‘be’, as in \REF{ex:pred:19}, \REF{ex:pred:20}, and \REF{ex:pred:21}.

Sentence (with missing item): inim mï ini ma=wat ___
Gloss (with missing item): water 3SG.SUBJ ground 3SG.OBJ=atop ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`There is water on the ground.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Often context alone can determine whether a \isi{copula}r \isi{suffix} is being used in an existential construction or a \isi{locative} construction. Thus, for example, a sentence such as \REF{ex:pred:20} could be interpreted as meaning ‘the water is on the ground’ as well as ‘there is water on the ground’.
A: word: p-e	 gloss: be{-ipfv}

Sentence (with missing item): mï amun=p-e ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SUBJ now=COP-DEP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`He is still there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb p- ‘be’ (or the \isi{copular enclitic} =p ‘\textsc{cop}’) may be used with \isi{temporal adverb}s or nouns as well, here having a \isi{temporal}, rather than a spatial meaning, as in the expression amunpe ‘still’ in \REF{ex:pred:10}. This can be understood as having the literal meaning ‘being at now’. See \sectref{sec:8.2.1} for more examples of \isi{temporal} expressions. The special \isi{past}-\isi{tense} form of the \isi{locative verb} (wap ‘be.\textsc{pst}’) is discussed in \sectref{sec:10.4}.
A: word: anda=p-e	 gloss: SG.DIST=be-IPFV

Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Mongima is a man.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Aside from \isi{locational predication}, which requires the \isi{locative verb} p- {\textasciitilde} wap ‘be’, \isi{non-verbal predication} (as well as other \isi{non-verbal clause} constructions) can be expressed without any overt verbal marking. Thus, Ulwa can be said to allow \isi{zero copula} constructions (see \sectref{sec:10.3}, however, for the use of a \isi{copular enclitic}). For example, \is{classificational clause} classificational, \is{identificational clause} identificational, or \is{equational clause} equational (or \is{equative clause} equative) clauses may all be expressed by simply \isi{juxtaposing} two NPs without any marking, as in examples \REF{ex:pred:22} through \REF{ex:pred:27}. See also example \REF{ex:det:159} in \sectref{sec:7.3}.

Sentence (with missing item): Alimban ma-nji ___ watangïnila
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.OBJ-POSS ___ four
The English translation of this sentence is:`Alimban has four sons.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Possessive predicates \is{possessive predication} can likewise be expressed without any marking. There is no verb like the \ili{English} verb have in Ulwa. Rather, the \isi{possessed} item is simply predicated of the person who possesses it. The \isi{possessor} is indicated by the \isi{possessive pronoun}. Thus, predicative \isi{possession} is expressed with the \isi{possessum} as the single argument of a \isi{monotransitive} clause; the \isi{possessor} is treated just like any \isi{adnominal possessor} in a possessive NP (i.e., it precedes the \isi{head noun}, \sectref{sec:9.1.5}). In examples \REF{ex:pred:30} through \REF{ex:pred:33}, the \isi{possessum} is indicated in \textbf{bold}.

Rather, it is used -- always optionally -- for other kinds of \isi{non-verbal clause}s. For example, \is{classificational clause} classificational, \is{identificational clause} identificational, or \is{existential clause} existential clauses may include the \isi{clitic} =p ‘\textsc{cop}’ at the end of the second NP, as in \REF{ex:pred:34}, \REF{ex:pred:35}, and \REF{ex:pred:36}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They were going to burn the grassland, but he went ahead [of them].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether a ‘going’ verb is marking futurity or \isi{purpose}.

In examples \REF{ex:pred:61} and \REF{ex:pred:62}, the \ili{English} translations capture the ambiguity well. In \REF{ex:pred:61}, a reading in which the ‘going’ verb marks futurity would suggest that the first clause is \isi{counterfactual}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether a ‘going’ verb is marking futurity or \isi{purpose}. This is perhaps unsurprising, if one assumes the likely historical change of: verb of \isi{motion} > \isi{purpose} > \isi{future}. In examples \REF{ex:pred:61} and \REF{ex:pred:62}, the \ili{English} translations capture the ambiguity well. In \REF{ex:pred:61}, a reading in which the ‘going’ verb marks futurity would suggest that the first clause is \isi{counterfactual}.
