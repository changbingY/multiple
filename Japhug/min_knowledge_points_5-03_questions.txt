Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): [lɯlu kɯ ___ ʁnɯz ʑo ka-ndo] pɯ-mto-t-a
Gloss (with missing item): cat ERG ___ two EMPH AOR:3\flobv{}-take AOR-see-PST:TR-1SG
The English translation of this sentence is:`I saw a cat catching two of them.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Discontinuous complement clauses are rare in Japhug. The only clear example in the corpus is (\ref{ex:lWlu.kW.aZo}). In this example, the \textsc{1sg} pronoun \forme{the morpheme ___} is the subject of the matrix clause, and has no syntactic role in the complement clause, but it appears between the transitive subject \forme{lɯlu kɯ} `the cat' and the object \japhug{ʁnɯz}{two} of the complement clause. Despite the rarity of this construction, this sentence was not considered to be unusual by \iai{Tshendzin} when listening again to the recording.
A: word: aʑo	 gloss: 1SG
B: word: aʑo-sti	 gloss: 1SG-alone
C: word: nɤʑo	 gloss: 2SG
D: word: pɣɤtɕɯ	 gloss: bird

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.POSS-companion DEM:PL ___ SBJ:PCP-cry dog SBJ:PCP-bark cat SBJ:PCP-cry INF:STAT-be.like DEM:PL IPFV-imitate SENS-be.able[III]
The English translation of this sentence is:`It is able to imitate other animals, sing like a bird, bark like a dog, meow like a cat or call like a fox.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The status of the clauses with subject participles occurring with these verbs, though superficially similar to the purposive clause (§\ref{sec:purposive.clause.motion.verbs}), is, however, entirely distinct. These clauses are not specific constructions, but simply headless relative clauses in object or semi-object function. This is shown by the fact that the same verbs are also found with participial head-internal clauses as in (\ref{ex:pGatCW.kWGAwu.tunWCpWz}), where the three nouns \japhug{the morpheme ___}{its gloss ___}, \japhug{kʰɯna}{dog} and \japhug{lɯlu}{cat} are intransitive subjects of the participial clauses, and are not coreferent with the subject of their matrix verb \forme{tu-nɯɕpɯz}. This example can be literally translated as `it is able to imitate a singing its gloss ___, a barking dog and a meowing cat.' (see also §\ref{sec:relative.pretence}).
A: word: pɣɤtɕɯ	 gloss: bird

The English translation of this sentence is:`She heard the sorcerer saying `Come and exchange [your] lamp'.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In (\ref{ex:WkWti.pjAmtshAm}), \forme{mtsʰɤm} even takes as object a head-internal relative clause in \forme{kɯ-} (rather than \forme{kɤ-} as in \ref{ex:YWsAmtsWG.kAti} above), with the transitive subject as relativized element (§\ref{sec:tr.subject.relativization}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`I control my blood sugar, I do what I can to prevent it from being too high'. (conversation, 15-12-05)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In examples (\ref{ex:kongzhi}) and (\ref{ex:kAtAB.ftCaka}), the head noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{method}, `its gloss ___' is neither a core argument nor an adjunct. It is not possible to convert the infinitive subordinate clauses \forme{mɯ-tu-kɤ-mbro} `not become too high' and \forme{qartsɤβ kɤ-kɤ-βzu ra kɤ-tɤβ} `thresh the (grains) that have been harvested' into independent sentences that would include \forme{the morpheme ___}. These clauses should therefore be analyzed as adnominal complement clauses, rather than a prenominal relatives.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I control my blood sugar, I do what I can to prevent it from being too high'. (conversation, 15-12-05)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The construction exemplified by (\ref{ex:kongzhi}) and (\ref{ex:kAtAB.ftCaka}) is a collocation combining the com\-ple\-ment-taking noun \forme{the morpheme ___} with the verb \japhug{βzu}{make}, meaning either `do by any means possible' (as in \ref{ex:kongzhi}) or `prepare to X' ( \ref{ex:kAtAB.ftCaka}). In the latter meaning, the collocation is homonymous with the transitive denominal verb \japhug{nɯthe morpheme ___}{prepare} (§\ref{sec:denom.tr.nW}), which also selects velar infinitive complements, as shown by (\ref{ex:kAtAB.kuwGnWftCaka}), uttered just before (\ref{ex:kAtAB.ftCaka}) in the same recording.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Other nouns like \japhug{ɯ-sɯm}{mind} (§\ref{sec:nouns.cognition.complement}) on the other hand select as possessor the experiencer, which may not be \textsc{3sg}, and the complement clause is not syntactically a possessor. For instance, in (\ref{ex:tutWndAm.nAsWm.WCe}) the possessor of \forme{-sɯm} is \textsc{2sg}, not \textsc{3sg} as would be expected if the finite clause \forme{nɯ-βdaʁmu nɯ tu-tɯ-ndɤm} were the possessor of this noun.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The alienably possessed nouns \japhug{ftɕaka}{method}, `its gloss ___' (§\ref{sec:compl.taking.nouns.denominal}) and \japhug{the morpheme ___}{its gloss ___},\footnote{These nouns are both translated into Chinese as \ch{办法}{bànfǎ}{method}, `means', `its gloss ___'.} both borrowed from Tibetan (from \tibet{བཅའ་ཀ}{btɕa.ka}{implement} and \tibet{བཀོད་པ}{bkod.pa}{arrangement}, `method', respectively), occur in collocation with the verb \japhug{βzu}{make} (§\ref{sec:Bzu.lv}) in the meanings `try to X by any means' (in Chinese \ch{想尽办法}{xiǎng jìn bànfǎ}{try to do by any means}) or `prepare'. They can select an infinitive clause with raising of the person indexation on the main verb, as shown by the 3\fl{}\textsc{2sg} form \forme{tɯ́-wɣ-βzu} `they will X you' in (\ref{ex:kAndza.the morpheme ___.tuwGBzu}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`(By these words) our father-in-law means that he does not want us to come back'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{language}, `sound' mainly takes complements when occurring with \japhug{βzu}{make} (§\ref{sec:Bzu.lv}) or \japhug{stu}{do like}. The collocation with this verbs means `do/say something that means X' as in (\ref{ex:ra.WskAt.ra.toBzu})\footnote{The poignant anecdote in (\ref{ex:ra.WskAt.ra.toBzu}) shows that the collocations \forme{the morpheme ___+βzu} and \forme{the morpheme ___+stu} are used even when the expression is not linguistic but based on gesture and facial expression. The hunter did not have the heart to shoot the monkey mother (see example \ref{ex:mWpjAcha.khi} in §\ref{sec:fsp.hearsay}). } or (\ref{ex:amAjAtWGinW.WskAt}) (in §\ref{sec:complement.taking.noun.possessor} above).

Gloss (with missing item): 3PL.POSS-queen DEM IPFV-2-take[III] ___ QU-go:FACT
The English translation of this sentence is:`Do you want to become their queen?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The noun of cognition \japhug{tɯ-sɯm}{mind} occur in collocation with the motion verb \japhug{ɕe}{go} in the meaning `want to X' (§\ref{sec:motion.light.verbs}) with either finite clause as in (\ref{ex:jutWCe.asWm.mWjCe}) and (\ref{ex:CkunWrNgWa.asWm}) (see also \ref{ex:tutWndAm.nAsWm.WCe} in §\ref{sec:complement.taking.noun.possessor}) or an infinitival one as in (\ref{ex:kAti.WsWm.mWpjACe})(\ref{ex:CWkArNgW.asWm}).

Gloss (with missing item): 3PL.POSS-queen DEM IPFV-2-take[III] ___ QU-go:FACT
The English translation of this sentence is:`Do you want to become their queen?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The possessive prefix on the com\-ple\-ment-taking noun encodes the experiencer, while the motion verb \japhug{ɕe}{go} remains in \textsc{3sg} form. When the complement clause is an infinitival clause, its subject must be coreferent with the experiencer in the main clause as in (\ref{ex:CWkArNgW.asWm}) and (\ref{ex:kAti.WsWm.mWpjACe}). However, when the complement clause is finite, subject corefence is possible (\ref{ex:CkunWrNgWa.asWm}, \ref{ex:tutWndAm.nAsWm.WCe}) but not required (\ref{ex:jutWCe.asWm.mWjCe}).
A: word: nɤ-sɯm	 gloss: 2SG.POSS-mind
