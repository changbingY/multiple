Gloss (with missing item): 3SG IAM cigarette=OBJ ___ get
The English translation of this sentence is:`He got one cigarette.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A classifier gives information about the classification of a noun. Kalamang classifiers, which are numeral prefixes, occupy the quantifier slot together with a numeral when modifying certain classes of nouns. When those nouns are modified by a numeral, the use of a classifier is obligatory. They can also be prefixed to the question word puraman `how many'. There are 16 classifiers, listed in Table~\ref{tab:class}. Those that are also bound roots that express part-whole relations (§\ref{sec:inal}) are marked accordingly. There are two unique classifiers (i.e. classifiers that apply to only one noun: \citealt{grinevald2007}): mir-\footnote{The West Bomberai language Mbaham has a word muur `branch' \parencite{flassy1987} and a transport classifier mu- \parencite{cottet2015}, and Iha has a classifier mur for boats, `motor' and branches (Katherine Walker, p.c.).} for the noun et `canoe' and pel- for the noun im `banana'.\footnote{While I elicited negative grammaticality judgments for mir- with, for example, other modes of transport or other things made of wood, I have not had the chance to test pel- in combination with nouns other than `banana'. In other words, the status of pel- as a unique classifier is based on its lack of appearance in combination with nouns other than `banana' in the current corpus.} An example with the classifier kis- for long thin things on the numeral kon `one', modifying the object tabai `cigarette', is given in~(\ref{exe:kiskon}). An example with the fruit classifier nak- and puraman `how many' is given in~(\ref{exe:watnak}).\is{noun!classification}\is{gender*}

The English translation of this sentence is:`We picked up I-don't-know-how-many coconuts like that.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A classifier gives information about the classification of a noun.

Sentence (with missing item): in marua [pas kanyot=at] ___ koluk
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL.EXCL move_seawards exactly giant_clam=OBJ ___ find
The English translation of this sentence is:`We went to sea and found four giant clams right there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Many nouns that are modified with a numeral are not attested with a classifier. Examples include all nouns referring to persons (unless they are in a group and following each other, in which case the group classifier ep- is used), shells as in~(\ref{exe:kanye}), landscape features like lempuang `island' and celestial bodies like pak `moon'. The latter two categories are perhaps not surprising, since they are less likely to be quantified with an exact number. Other nouns associate with more than one classifier (though not at the same time), depending on which characteristic of the nominal referent is being emphasised. This way, classifiers help specify whether we are talking about the leaves, the stem or the fruit of a plant, or whether we are talking about a halved fish, fish as single entities, fish on a string or schools of fish. To take another example, mun `lime' can be modified with the classifier for halves tabak- if it is cut cross-wise, or with the fruit classifier nak- if it is whole. Consider also the examples with sayang `nutmeg' in~(\ref{exe:sayangya}):
A: word: kansuor-i	 gloss: four-OBJQNT
B: word: kansuor	 gloss: four
C: word: karuok-i	 gloss: three-OBJQNT

Sentence (with missing item): kian ma sala-un ___ kon∼kon=nin
Gloss (with missing item): wife.1SG.POSS 3SG mistake-3POSS ___ one∼RED=NEG
The English translation of this sentence is:`My wife's mistake doesn't matter.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition, reduplication of kon `one' has indefinite-like meanings\is{indefinite pronoun}. The use of konkon with a negated verb and combined with the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' so that we get \textit{the morpheme ___ konkon Verb=\textsc{neg}} results in the meaning `noits gloss ___', as exemplified in~(\ref{exe:dkonkon1}). Konkon=nin can also be used predicatively, inflected with the negator =nin itself, where it means `it doesn't matter'. See~(\ref{exe:dkonkonn2}). These constructions are well-established in the corpus.
