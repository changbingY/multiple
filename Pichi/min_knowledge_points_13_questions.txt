Sentence (with missing item): Mék yu nó sé yu dɔ́n gɛ́t ___ na pueblo, na kɔ́ntri.
Gloss (with missing item): SBJV 2SG know QUOT 2SG PRF get ___ LOC village LOC country
The English translation of this sentence is:‘You should know that you already have a fiancé in the village, in the hometown.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Inserted Spanish constituents belong to various word classes, but the insertion of content words, and nouns in particular, prevails. Thus we find the morpheme ___ ‘fiancé’ and pueblo ‘village’ in \REF{ex:key:1696}. Note that both Spanish nouns are objects\is{objects} of Pichi elements, the first of a verb, the second of a preposition:
A: word: novio	 gloss: boyfriend
B: word: violeta	 gloss: violet
C: word: bɔ́y	 gloss: boy

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Then you [plural] buy the bricks tomorrow.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a specific Spanish plural noun is inserted, there is a strong likelihood that it will be additionally marked with the postposed Pichi pluraliser dɛn, in accordance with the pattern that applies to Pichi count nouns \REF{ex:key:1698}. Conversely, Spanish nouns exhibit a strong tendency to occur devoid of Pichi number and definiteness\is{definiteness} marking where the noun is non-specific as with rallador ‘grater’ in the second example:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a specific Spanish plural noun is inserted, there is a strong likelihood that it will be additionally marked with the postposed Pichi pluraliser the morpheme ___, in accordance with the pattern that applies to Pichi count nouns \REF{ex:key:1698}. Conversely, Spanish nouns exhibit a strong tendency to occur devoid of Pichi number and definiteness\is{definiteness} marking where the noun is non-specific as with rallador ‘grater’ in the second example:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Me and Rubi, we teamed up and bought avocados, we bought sardines, we bought tomatoes, we had breakfast.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This is not surprising however, since in Spanish, determiner-less plural count nouns may have non-specific reference. The semantic overlap between Spanish plural nouns and Pichi bare nouns in codemixing can be seen in \REF{ex:key:1701}. Here the Pichi bare nouns pía ‘avocado’ and sadín ‘sardine’ are functionally equivalent to the Spanish plural noun the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’:

Sentence (with missing item): Na ___ directa e mék.
Gloss (with missing item): FOC ___ direct 3SG.SBJ make
The English translation of this sentence is:‘It’s a direct translation that she made.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The insertion of larger nominal groups as opposed to single nouns is rarer. In fact, most of the Spanish adjective-noun combinations we encounter are collocations that are somewhat lexicalised in Spanish. Compare the morpheme ___ directa ‘direct its gloss ___’ in \REF{ex:key:1702}:
A: word: traducción	 gloss: translation
B: word: relación	 gloss: relation

The English translation of this sentence is:‘If you had begun last week you would have been finished today.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The order of constituents normally remains unchanged when Spanish elements are inserted into a Pichi NP. In \REF{ex:key:1703}, the Pichi quantifier\is{quantifiers} lás ‘the morpheme ___t’ is used in prenominal position with the inserted Spanish noun semana ‘week’. However, note that Spanish also features a quantifier + noun order in NPs (i.e. la última semana ‘(the) the morpheme ___t week’):
A: word: las	 gloss: last
B: word: kɔ́tlas	 gloss: cutlass
C: word: estudiante	 gloss: student

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The order of constituents normally remains unchanged when Spanish elements are inserted into a Pichi NP. In \REF{ex:key:1703}, the Pichi quantifier\is{quantifiers} lás ‘last’ is used in prenominal position with the inserted Spanish noun the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘She brought (a) fish, she cooked a particular fish and gave it to me in order to eat.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:1705}, we find the opposite situation. The Spanish adjective the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is in a prenominal position, hence in the syntactic slot of attributively used Pichi property items:
A: word: especial	 gloss: special
B: word: respira	 gloss: breathe
C: word: tín	 gloss: thing
D: word: cuaderno	 gloss: exercise.book
Please only return the letter (A–D).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘“Dí man dé trɔn” is not nice, it doesn’t have a proper meaning.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are other instances of Spanish adjectives that follow Pichi nouns in Pichi NPs. But in these cases, the function of the Spanish words parallels that of some Pichi value property items that are used as adverbials in the same syntactic position. The Spanish adjective serio ‘serious’ in \REF{ex:key:1706} may be likened to the Pichi manner adverb fáyn ‘well, really’ in \REF{ex:key:1707}:
A: word: sentido	 gloss: meaning
B: word: ventilador	 gloss: fan
C: word: mín	 gloss: mean
D: word: ser	 gloss: be

The English translation of this sentence is:‘From here they control the woman.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The admixture of Spanish verbs follows established rules. Spanish verbs are always inserted into Pichi clauses in an invariant form of the \textsc{3sg} person of the Spanish present tense\is{present tense} paradigm. This insertion rule is valid without exception across the three regular Spanish verb inflection classes. Due to its frequency, the \textsc{3sg} present tense form is also the default form found in most contact scenarios involving Spanish (\citealt[20–21]{Clements2009}). Examples follow with the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ (<the morpheme ___r) in \REF{ex:key:1709}, entiende ‘understand’ (<entender) in \REF{ex:key:1710}, and sufre ‘suffer’ (<sufrir) in \REF{ex:key:1711}:

Inserted Spanish verbs may also be reduplicated by the same derivational process that applies to Pichi verbs.

Sentence (with missing item): Fíba nó ___ ín.
Gloss (with missing item): fever NEG ___ 3SG.INDP
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The fever hasn’t risen on him.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Pichi exhibits a phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy in the pronominal system. The lexical pitch configuration of a verb determines the choice of allomorph used for the expression of \textsc{3sg} pronominal object case (cf. \sectref{sec:3.2.5}). Vowel-final verbs with a word-final low tone take the object pronoun ín ‘\textsc{3sg.indp}’ – this group includes a few Pichi verbs and all inserted Spanish verbs \REF{ex:key:1713}. This is because the \textsc{3sg} invariant form of the Equatoguinean Spanish verb always features a word-final L-toned vowel:
A: word: sube	 gloss: go.up
B: word: rubi	 gloss: NAME
C: word: gráp	 gloss: get.up
D: word: pamáyn	 gloss: oil

The English translation of this sentence is:‘So many cars were there, I didn’t know Pancho pretended to go up behind us (and) went down again.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In a similar vein, the verbs the morpheme ___ (<subir) ‘go up’ and baja (<bajar) ‘go down’ are far more frequent than their Pichi counterparts gó ɔ́p and gó dɔ́n \REF{ex:key:1715}: \is{loan words}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Spanish discourse markers and adverbs frequently occur at the beginning of a sentence.

Conversely, the interjection chico ‘boy’ \REF{ex:key:1736} is not common in European Spanish. It might have developed in Equatoguinean Spanish and Pichi through mutual reinforcement and calquing of other person-denoting interjections in Pichi and other Equatoguinean languages.
