Sentence (with missing item): ... apa biologi ___ apa astronomi dengang bahasa Inggris
Gloss (with missing item): ... what biology ___ what astronomy with language England
The English translation of this sentence is:[About a school competition] ‘[later they’ll participate in the Olympiad contest in,] what-is-it, biology and, what-is-it, astronomy and English’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{comitative} \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, its gloss ___ its short form \textitbf{deng}, typically conjoins \isi{noun} phrases (654 tokens). The conjoined referents can be animate as in (\ref{Example_14.6}), or inanimate as in (\ref{Example_14.7}). The fact that Papuan Malay employs the same marker for “\isi{noun} phrase \isi{conjunction} and \isi{comitative} phrases” suggests that, in terms of \citegen[1]{Stassen.2013b} typology, Papuan Malay is a ``\textsc{its gloss ___}{}-language''. Occasionally, \textitbf{deng(ang)} ‘its gloss ___’ also links \isi{verb} phrases (16 tokens) as in (\ref{Example_14.8}). The linking of clauses its gloss ___ \isi{comitative} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is unattested in the corpus. (Besides, \isi{comitative} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is also used to encode inclusory \isi{conjunction} constructions, as discussed in §\ref{Para_6.1.4}; for a detailed discussion of \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, see §\ref{Para_10.2.1}.)

Question 15:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ Pawlus dej sandar di dei pu badang begini,
Gloss (with missing item): ___ Pawlus 3SG lean at 3SG POSS body like.this
The English translation of this sentence is:‘but then Pawlus was leaning against her body like this’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Typically, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘and then’ occurs in clause-initial position where it marks an immediate subsequent event or action, similar to \isi{sequential} \textitbf{trus} ‘next’ (§\ref{Para_14.2.3.1}). Concurrently, however, the \isi{conjunction} signals another piece of information, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.25}) (note that this example presents contiguous text). Depending on the context, the \isi{conjunction} marks noteworthy parts and/or signals a new aspect or perspective regarding the event or discourse unfolding. In this case \textitbf{the morpheme ___} translates with ‘but then’, as in (\ref{Example_14.25b}) or ‘and then’ as in (\ref{Example_14.25c}). Alternatively, the \isi{conjunction} signals that the event depicted in its clause does not occur until after the event of the preceding clause. In this case, it translates with ‘only then’, as in (\ref{Example_14.25a}). In marking contrastive sequentiality, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘and then’ differs from \textitbf{trus} ‘next’ which indicates neutral sequentiality (see §\ref{Para_14.2.3.1}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Usually, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ marks \isi{anteriority}. That is, it signals that the event or state of the unmarked clause occurs prior to that of the temporal clause, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.27}). Concurrently, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ marks temporal extent in that it indicates that the event or state of the unmarked clause continues its gloss ___ the event or state of the temporal clause comes about. Depending on the context, temporal \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ can also receive a \isi{resultative} reading in the sense of ``with the result that'', as in (\ref{Example_14.28}). Given that the \isi{resultative} reading of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is the derived, marginal one, this result-marking function of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is not further discussed in §\ref{Para_14.2.4}.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘he said, ``before we go to the city, we wash (our) faces first'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Anteriority-marking \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ also introduces a temporal clause.\footnote{The \isi{conjunction} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is \isi{historically derived} from the aspectual ad\isi{verb} \textitbf{blum} ‘not yet’: \textitbf{se-blum} ‘one-not.yet’ (see §\ref{Para_5.4.1}).} It indicates – similar to \textitbf{sampe} ‘until’ – that the event or state of the unmarked clause occurs prior to that of the temporal clause. Unlike \textitbf{sampe} ‘until’, however, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ does not signal extent. The temporal clause with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ can precede or follow the unmarked clause, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.29}) and (\ref{Example_14.30}), respectively. In the corpus, however, the temporal clause more often precedes the unmarked clause (21 tokens) rather than follows it (8 tokens).

The English translation of this sentence is:[Talking to her son about an upcoming trip:] ‘if you play hooky, we won’t go’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In a dits gloss ___ferent context, the \isi{conjunction} receives a \isi{conditional} reading and signals, what \citet[6]{Kaufmann.2006} calls, ``indicative \isi{conditional}'' relations or ``counterfactual \isi{conditional}'' relations. In such a context \textitbf{the morpheme ___} translates with ‘its gloss ___’. An indicative \isi{conditional} relation indicates that it is possible for the \isi{condition} presented in its clause to be met. In this case the event or state of the unmarked clause will also come about, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.33}). When \isi{conditional} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ co-occurs with retrospective \textitbf{suda} ‘already’, the clause receives a counterfactual \isi{conditional} reading. That is, it signals that the \isi{condition} was not met in the past. If the \isi{condition} had been met, however, then the event or state of the unmarked clause would also have come about. This is illustrated in (\ref{Example_14.34}).

The English translation of this sentence is:[About a small boy:] ‘Musa here, uh, right now he’s kind of weak since he woke up from sleeping’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Alternatively, but less often, the \isi{conjunction} occurs in clause-final position of a cause clause where it marks a \isi{causal} relation with the preceding unmarked clause, as in (\ref{Example_14.37}). In this position, the \isi{conjunction} signals that its gloss ___mething depicted in its clause is the cause for the event or state of the unmarked clause, and that the result depicted in the unmarked clause is anticipated. Hence, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} translates with ‘since’. In that the result is expected, \isi{causal} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘since’ differs from neutral causality-marking \textitbf{karna} ‘because’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.4}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purposive \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘so that’ introduces a purpose clause which follows the unmarked clause. The \isi{conjunction} signals that the event or state of its clause is the intended outcome of the deliberate activity depicted in the unmarked clause. Most often, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘so that’ introduces a purpose clause with an overt subject (96/129 tokens – 74%), as in (\ref{Example_14.38}). Less often, the \isi{conjunction} introduces a purpose clause with elided subject (33/129 tokens – 26%), as in (\ref{Example_14.39}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As a \isi{conjunction}, the benefactive \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ signals a purpose relation between two clauses (its gloss ___ a description of \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, see §\ref{Para_10.2.3}). Purposive \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, like \textitbf{supaya} ‘so that’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.2}), introduces a purpose clause which expresses the intended outcome of the purposeful activity depicted in the preceding unmarked clause, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.40}) and (\ref{Example_14.41}). Usually, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ introduces a purpose clause with an elided subject (115/163 tokens – 71%), as shown with the second \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ token in (\ref{Example_14.40}). Much less often the \isi{conjunction} introduces a purpose clause with an overt subject (48/163tokens – 29%), as shown with the first \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ token in (\ref{Example_14.40}), or as in (\ref{Example_14.41}).

Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ... tida bole, ini, kamu datang, ___ kamu skola
Gloss (with missing item): ... NEG may D.PROX 2PL come ___ 2PL go.to.school
The English translation of this sentence is:‘[you shouldn’t hate each other, (you) shouldn’t infuriate each other,] (you) shouldn’t (do all this), what’s-its-name, you came (here) to go to school’ (Lit. ‘for you (to) go to school’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As a \isi{conjunction}, the benefactive \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ signals a purpose relation between two clauses (its gloss ___ a description of \isi{preposition} \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, see §\ref{Para_10.2.3}). Purposive \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, like \textitbf{supaya} ‘so that’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.2}), introduces a purpose clause which expresses the intended outcome of the purposeful activity depicted in the preceding unmarked clause, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.40}) and (\ref{Example_14.41}). Usually, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ introduces a purpose clause with an elided subject (115/163 tokens – 71%), as shown with the second \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ token in (\ref{Example_14.40}). Much less often the \isi{conjunction} introduces a purpose clause with an overt subject (48/163tokens – 29%), as shown with the first \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ token in (\ref{Example_14.40}), or as in (\ref{Example_14.41}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Causal \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ signals a neutral \isi{causal} relation between two clauses by introducing a cause clause which gives the reason for the event or state depicted in the unmarked clause. Usually the cause clause follows the unmarked clause, as in (\ref{Example_14.42}). In combination with \isi{adversative} \textitbf{tapi} ‘but’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.5.1}), however, it can precede the unmarked clause, as in (\ref{Example_14.43}). In this case the unmarked clause is often introduced with \isi{resultative} \textitbf{jadi} ‘so’. Signaling neutral causality, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ is distinct from \isi{causal} \textitbf{jadi} ‘since’ which marks expected results (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.1}), and from \isi{causal} \textitbf{gara-gara} ‘its gloss ___’ which marks emotive \isi{causal} relations (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.5}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Most often, the cause clause marked with \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ follows the unmarked clause, as in (\ref{Example_14.44}). Alternatively, the cause clause can precede the unmarked clause. In this case, \isi{adversative} \textitbf{tapi} ‘but’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.5.1}) precedes \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’, as in (\ref{Example_14.45}), in the same way as \textitbf{tapi} ‘but’ precedes \textitbf{karna} ‘its gloss ___’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.4.4}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘say (to) father, ``send us money, after all, I have difficulties, right?'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Introducing a contrast clause that follows the unmarked clause, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘after all’ summarizes what has been said before and signals that the propositional content of its clause is true in spite of the content of the preceding unmarked clause, as shown in (\ref{Example_14.48}) and (\ref{Example_14.49}). At the same time, the \isi{conjunction} signals that the interlocutor is expected to know that this content is true. Thereby \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘after all’ is distinct from \isi{adversative} \textitbf{tapi} ‘but’ (see §\ref{Para_14.2.5.2}). Adversative \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘after all’ is also distinct from counter-expectational \textitbf{baru} ‘after all’ which merely summarizes what has been said before (see §\ref{Para_14.2.3.2}). The exchange in (\ref{Example_14.49}) illustrates that there does not need to be an overt unmarked clause which precedes the contrast clause: speakers also use \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘after all’ to reply to an interlocutor’s statements.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Introducing a concession clause, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ signals that despite the event or state depicted in its clause, the event or state depicted in the unmarked clause occurred. Usually, the concession clause precedes the unmarked clause, whereby the concession is emphasized, as in (\ref{Example_14.52}). Alternatively, its gloss ___ less often, it can follow the unmarked clause, in which case the content of the latter clause is emphasized, as in (\ref{Example_14.53}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When core arguments are relativized, a gap is left. This gap, signified with ``Ø'', occurs where the relativized \isi{noun} phrase would be situated if it were expressed overtly. Relativization of the subject argument is illustrated in (\ref{Example_14.62}), and of the direct object argument of a \isi{bivalent} \isi{verb}, namely \textitbf{biking} ‘make’, in (\ref{Example_14.63}). The examples in (\ref{Example_14.64}) and (\ref{Example_14.65}) illustrate the relativization of the direct object positions in \isi{double-object} constructions; in both examples the \isi{trivalent} \isi{verb} is \textitbf{kasi} ‘give’. In (\ref{Example_14.64}), the R argument \textitbf{papeda} ‘sagu porridge’ is relativized. In (\ref{Example_14.65}), the T argument \textitbf{Efana ini} ‘this Efana’ is relativized. (Verbal clauses with \isi{bivalent} and \isi{trivalent} verbs are discussed in detail in §\ref{Para_11.1.2} and §\ref{Para_11.1.3}, respectively.)

Question 50:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Fitri ___ de bapa kasi Ø ijing mo ikut ke kampung
Gloss (with missing item): Fitri ___ 3SG father give ... permission want follow to village
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(it was) Fitri whom her husband gave permission to go with (us) to the village’ (Lit. ‘her (daughter’s) father ...’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When core arguments are relativized, a gap is left. This gap, signified with ``Ø'', occurs where the relativized \isi{noun} phrase would be situated if it were expressed overtly. Relativization of the subject argument is illustrated in (\ref{Example_14.62}), and of the direct object argument of a \isi{bivalent} \isi{verb}, namely \textitbf{biking} ‘make’, in (\ref{Example_14.63}). The examples in (\ref{Example_14.64}) and (\ref{Example_14.65}) illustrate the relativization of the direct object positions in \isi{double-object} constructions; in both examples the \isi{trivalent} \isi{verb} is \textitbf{kasi} ‘give’. In (\ref{Example_14.64}), the R argument \textitbf{papeda} ‘sagu porridge’ is relativized. In (\ref{Example_14.65}), the T argument \textitbf{Efana ini} ‘this Efana’ is relativized. (Verbal clauses with \isi{bivalent} and \isi{trivalent} verbs are discussed in detail in §\ref{Para_11.1.2} and §\ref{Para_11.1.3}, respectively.)
A: word: yang	 gloss: REL
