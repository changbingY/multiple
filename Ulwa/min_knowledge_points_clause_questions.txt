The English translation of this sentence is:`My daughters -- I told them: …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sometimes, in \isi{transitive} clauses, emphasis can be placed on an object by fronting it to the beginning of the clause. Even in such instances, however, the order of the clause (following this arguably preclausal element) is usually still SOV, since the referent of the fronted object invariably appears again in the clause, marked by an \isi{agreement} marker immediately preceding the verb, as in examples \REF{ex:clause:21} through \REF{ex:clause:24}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`If [they] give her [it], then she will scrape sago palms with it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given the nature of real-world scenarios involved in the act of giving, it is common for sentences referring to ‘giving’ events to include three participants: \isi{giver} (\isi{agent}), \isi{recipient} (\isi{benefactive}), and \isi{gift} (\isi{theme}). As such, these three participants are often all expressed in Ulwa ‘giving’ constructions, generally through the use of at least two verbs. It is, however, possible for the verb na- ‘give’ to occur without any other verb encoding the \isi{theme} argument; in such instances, the only two roles expressed (as determined by the verb’s argument structure) are the \isi{giver} (the grammatical subject) and the \isi{recipient} (the grammatical object), as in \REF{ex:clause:31} and \REF{ex:clause:32}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Alma gave a pig to Kongos.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the \isi{theme} (\isi{gift}) is also overtly expressed, it is necessary to use another verb. The verb that is most commonly used along with na- ‘give’ in these constructions is the verb tï- ‘take’ (see \sectref{sec:4.3}). This first verb, tï- ‘take’, has as its object the \isi{theme} (that which is given), whereas the second verb, na- ‘give’, has as its object the beneficiary (to whom something is given), as in examples \REF{ex:clause:33} through \REF{ex:clause:40}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Alma gave a pig to Kongos.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since the verb tï- ‘take’ is often \isi{defective}, as in most of examples \REF{ex:clause:33} through \REF{ex:clause:40}, it looks very much like these are \isi{separable verb} constructions (\sectref{sec:9.2.1}). However, given the verbal nature of tï- ‘take’, these ‘giving’ constructions can instead be described as a modest form of \isi{serial verb construction}s.\footnote{Although not quite fitting some stricter criteria for \isi{serial verb construction}s \citep[8]{Aikhenvald2006}, since (as a \isi{defective verb}) tï- ‘take’ does not match na- ‘give’ in its \isi{TAM} marking, these Ulwa ‘giving’ constructions qualify as such under definitions such as \citegen[296]{Haspelmath2016}: “a \isi{monoclausal construction} consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no \isi{predicate}-argument relation between the verbs”. That said, when it lacks \isi{TAM} marking, tï- ‘take’ is not clearly finite.} Even if we are to consider these ‘giving’ constructions to be instances of \isi{serial verb construction}s in Ulwa, then verb serialization is certainly not a productive \isi{syntactic} construction -- if it indeed exists in the language, then it is restricted to encoding what might be considered “\isi{ditransitive} events”.

When the first verb tï- ‘take’ is marked for \isi{TAM}, it must also receive the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’ (\sectref{sec:12.2.1}), proving, as it were, that this verb belongs to a separate clause.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentence \REF{ex:clause:41} may be rendered more literally as: ‘After [they] took the bones, and after [they] gave Wombasame, he was acting with them.’ Finally, it should be said that the instances in which tï- ‘take’ does not receive any \isi{TAM} marking could be considered a very modest form of \isi{clause chaining}, although, if so, then there would be only one \isi{medial clause} involved (see \sectref{sec:12.4} for more on possible \isi{clause-chaining} structures in Ulwa). Furthermore, the fact the tï- ‘take’ is so often \isi{defective} even in monoverbal, \isi{monoclausal sentence}s makes its putative dependence on the “\isi{final verb}” less diagnostic.

In the remainder of this section I describe how ‘showing’ events are encoded in Ulwa. Whereas ‘giving’ events in Ulwa are encoded with two \isi{transitive} verbs (typically tï- ‘take’ and na- ‘give’), ‘showing’ events are encoded with a single \isi{intransitive} verb (si- ‘push’). In other contexts, this verb is used \isi{transitive}ly \REF{ex:clause:49}, often in conjunction with the verb lï- ‘put’, to covey the sense of something being pushed upon something else, as in \REF{ex:clause:50} and \REF{ex:clause:51}, or in conjunction with the preverbal form [ikali] (literally ‘hand-send’) to convey the act of grabbing, holding, or catching, as in \REF{ex:clause:52} and \REF{ex:clause:53}.\footnote{Like tï- ‘take’, si- ‘push’ is often \isi{defective} in that it commonly lacks \isi{perfective} or \isi{imperfective} \isi{aspect} marking.}

Question 57:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: While ‘giving’ is the prototypical event to be encoded by \isi{ditransitive} constructions (in languages that exhibit them), there are other verbs that are likely to function similarly crosslinguistically.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When used to encode a ‘showing’ event, however, the verb si- ‘push’ is \isi{intransitive}: the \isi{agent} (the one showing) is the subject of the verb; the \isi{theme} (that which is shown) is marked by the \isi{oblique marker} =n ‘\textsc{obl}’; and the \isi{experiencer} (the one to whom something is shown) is the object of the \isi{postposition} ul ‘with’. The preferred order of these two non-core arguments is for the \isi{oblique}-marked \isi{noun phrase} to precede the \isi{postpositional phrase}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Aside from this one hunger construction, there does not seem to be a robust \isi{morphosyntactic} distinction made in Ulwa between \isi{predicate}s expressing \isi{controlled} events and \isi{predicate}s expressing \isi{uncontrolled} events or states. Other expressions of physical or emotional states, such as pain, sickness, anger, and sadness, are not expressed with the \isi{experiencer} as the grammatical object, as is done for expressions of hunger. For example, pain is usually expressed by predicating apïn ‘pain’ (literally ‘fire’) of the person or body part that is experiencing pain \REF{ex:clause:93}.
