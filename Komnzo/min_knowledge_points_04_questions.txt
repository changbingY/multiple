The English translation of this sentence is:`She was sorting (the things) properly ... She put the things back in the houses.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We find that \isi{case} markers make a distinction between \isi{animate} and \isi{inanimate} referents. For certain cases, there are designated formatives for \isi{animate} referents, for example all the spatial cases. Only with \isi{animate} referents is there a \isi{number} distinction ({\Sg} vs. {\Nsg}) in the \isi{case} markers. Consider examples (\ref{ex722}-\ref{ex724}). The first example shows the \isi{locative} \isi{case} on mnz `house', and the context of the story reveals that this is about several houses. The \isi{case} marker, however, does not encode \isi{number}. Examples (\ref{ex723}) and (\ref{ex724}) show that this is different for \isi{animate} referents, and the \isi{case} markers make a \isi{singular} versus \isi{non-singular} distinction.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: These formatives attach to the rightmost element of the phrase, but have scope over the whole \isi{noun phrase}. In example (\ref{ex485}), the adjective the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' precedes the noun nzram `flower' and the \isi{case} marker attaches to the latter. Example (\ref{ex484}) shows the same adjective postposed to the noun yfö `hole'. Again, the \isi{case} marker attaches to the rightmost element.
A: word: katan	 gloss: small

Sentence (with missing item): ___ zä zf wa\stem{m}nzr.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ PROX IMM FSG:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/dwell.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I live right here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{absolutive} \isi{case} is almost always unmarked. The \isi{non-singular} \isi{clitic} (=é), (=yé) when it follows a vowel, is rarely used. On the clausal level the \isi{absolutive} encodes the single argument of \isi{intransitive} verbs (\ref{ex486}), or the \isi{patient} argument of \isi{transitive} verbs (\ref{ex487}).
A: word: nzä	 gloss: FSG.ABS

The English translation of this sentence is:`That was when father put me in school.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{absolutive} \isi{case} is almost always unmarked.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ FPL:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:IRR:PFV/start DEM:PROX IMM FSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/roll.
The English translation of this sentence is:`We would start twisting it. I am twisting this here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a nominalised verb functions as the \isi{patient} of a matrix clause, it appears with no overt \isi{case} marking. It could be analysed as being marked with \isi{absolutive} \isi{case}, though for reasons of parsimony I will not \isi{gloss} it as such. This commonly occurs with phasal verbs, like in (\ref{ex488}), where the speaker shows me how to make a whistle from a coconut leaf.
A: word: myukn-si	 gloss: roll-NMLZ
B: word: kn-si=ma	 gloss: roll-NMLZ=CHAR

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ama=é bä thfa\stem{m}rnm ksi kar=en.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ mother=ABS.NSG MED STDU:SBJ:PST:DUR/dwell bush place=LOC.
The English translation of this sentence is:`My two mothers lived there in the bush.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Overt marking of \isi{non-singular} \isi{number} is possible if the referent is \isi{animate}. The formative is =é if the host is consonant-final, and =yé if it is vowel-final. Hence, there is a syncretism between \isi{absolutive} and \isi{ergative} \isi{non-singular}. This pattern of syncretism is also found in the first \isi{person} pronouns ({\S}\ref{personalpronouns-sec}), where ni is used for both \isi{ergative} and \isi{absolutive} \isi{non-singular}. As a \isi{case} marker on \isi{absolutive} noun phrases it is very rare. One example is given in (\ref{ex609}).
A: word: nzone	 gloss: FSG.POSS
B: word: nzone=wä	 gloss: FSG.POSS=EMPH

The English translation of this sentence is:`Okay, he said to the old woman: ``Mother, the Nzürna woman is chasing after me!'' The old woman told him: ``That is why I told you: Don't go there!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{ergative} \isi{case} marker is =f (\Sg) or =é (\Nsg). The \isi{ergative} usually operates at the clausal level. It encodes the semantic role of actor or \isi{stimulus}. Example (\ref{ex463}) is taken from a ``Nzürna story''. These stories are widespread in the Morehead region. The main character the morpheme ___, but also the plot of the stories, bears some resemblance to the classic European witch stories.

Question 19:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ z zwe\stem{faf}.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ IAM STSG:SBJ>FSG:OBJ:Rpst:PFV/hold.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I am already scared.' (lit. `Fear already holds me.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Experiencer-object constructions, in which the \isi{stimulus} receives the \isi{ergative} and the \isi{experiencer} the absolutive, are quite common. Constructions of this type have been described for \ili{Kalam} by Pawley et al. (\citeyear{Pawley:2000vp}) and for \ili{Nen} by Evans (\citeyear{Evans:2015wy}). As in \ili{Kalam}, \isi{experiencer-object} constructions are often used to express bodily and mental processes. In example (\ref{ex467}), after an evening by the fire, the speaker proclaims that she will go to sleep now because `fear has already grabbed her'.
A: word: wtri=f	 gloss: fear=ERG
B: word: wtri=karä=sü	 gloss: fear=PROP=ETC

Sentence (with missing item): ___ fthé sa\stem{bth}a.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ when STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:PFV/finish.
The English translation of this sentence is:`That is when he got really angry.' (lit. `That is when anger finished him.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex468}) comes from a story about a man who was angry and tried to shock people at a feast. The fact that he was infuriated is expressed literally as `anger/grudges finished him'. Note that (\ref{ex468}) is an exception to the rule that inanimate referents do not receive number marking for case enclitics. Such exceptions are rare in the corpus. There is one more example of this type in the grammar (page \pageref{ex583} example \ref{ex583}), which is also an experiencer-object construction. I take this as evidence, that experiencer-object constructions rank the stimulus argument higher in animacy, i.e. the stimulus is portrayed as being animate. See \S\ref{expobjconstr} for a more detailed discussion of experiencer-object constructions.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He was cracking those (coconut shells). This cracking was blocking his ears.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{ergative} \isi{case} can also be attached to nominalised verbs, as in (\ref{ex469}). This example is about a \ili{Marind} headhunter who was trying to distract the people by imitating the sound that dogs make when they chew on bones. The poor guy was so busy making this noise that he did not hear how the villagers were approaching him. Hence, it is the \isi{infinitive} of `crack' which receives the \isi{ergative} \isi{case} in (\ref{ex469}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`They piled up the firewood and started to burn it ... but she was concentrated on weaving the mat there in the tree hole.' (lit. `The mat weaving did her.')
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Thus, the \isi{ergative} \isi{case} can also function at the interclausal level. Example (\ref{ex470}) shows that the infinitive to which the \isi{ergative} is attached may also take an \isi{object}. In the example a malevolent spirit, who lives in a tree, is about to be burned by an angry mob. She does not notice the fire at first because she is too concentrated on weaving a its gloss ___. The `its gloss ___ weaving' receives the \isi{ergative}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`As for my garden there in Safs, I left it for them ... for the Safs people.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{dative} \isi{case} marker is =n (\Sg) or =nm (\Nsg). It operates at the clausal level and encodes the semantic role of (\isi{animate}) \isi{recipient} or \isi{goal}. If it is attached to a \isi{place name}, as in example (\ref{ex460}), the people of that place are meant, not the place. The \isi{dative} is categorised as a core \isi{case} because a \isi{dative} marked noun phrase is indexed in the verb, as in the verb form thägathinza in (\ref{ex460}). Unlike in other \ili{Tonda} languages, for example in \ili{Ngkolmpu} (\citealt{Carroll:Ngkolmpu}), the \isi{dative} \isi{case} cannot be used adnominally to mark a \isi{possessor}.

Gloss (with missing item): tell-NMLZ which IMMpst=FSG:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/tell EMPH ... ___ ... ancestor=ABL DEM EMPH STSG:OBJ:PST:IPFV:VENIT/pass EMPH.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The story which I have just told ... was really passed to the fathers from the ancestor(s).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The formatives in \tabref{caseformatives} might suggest a syncretism between the \isi{dative} \isi{case} and the \isi{locative} \isi{case}. The \isi{singular} marker of the \isi{dative} is =n, and the \isi{locative} marker is also =n when it attaches to a vowel-final word (for consonant-final words, it is =en). However, no syncretism takes place because (i) inanimates do not take \isi{dative} =(e)n, and (ii) \isi{animate} referents receive a special formative of the \isi{locative} \isi{case} (=dben). Moreover, there is some variation for the \isi{dative} when it is attached to a vowel-final word. For example, the word ŋafe `father' with the \isi{dative} =n can be pronounced as [ŋaβen], [ŋaβeʔə̆n] or [ŋaɸjə̆n] (\ref{ex461}).
A: word: ŋafe=nm	 gloss: father=DAT.NSG

The English translation of this sentence is:`The story which I have just told ... was really passed to the fathers from the ancestor(s).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In terms of meaning, there is some overlap between the \isi{allative} and the \isi{dative} \isi{case}. Example (\ref{ex461}) concludes an origin myth, and the speaker points out how the story was passed on from the ancestor. The noun phrase ŋafynm `for/to the fathers' marks a \isi{goal}. This could be equally expressed with an \isi{allative} \isi{case} marker ŋafemedbo `to the fathers'.\footnote{Note that the verb ŋanritakwa `it (was) passed' does not index the dative noun phrase ŋafynm `for/to the fathers', but instead occurs in a suppressed-object construction (\S\ref{suppressedobjectclause}).}

Question 35:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ mezü \stem{rä}ra ... masen=ane mezü.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ widow TSG.F:SBJ:PST:IPFV/be ... masen=POSS.SG widow.
The English translation of this sentence is:`She was this one's widow ... Masen's widow.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{possessive} \isi{case} is =ane (\Sg) or =aneme (\Nsg). It marks the semantic role of \isi{possessor}, and the noun or \isi{noun phrase} to which it attaches always functions adnominally. Examples (\ref{ex446}) and (\ref{ex447}) show \isi{animate} possessors.

Question 54:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): wati ___ zwä\stem{kor} bone dagon fof e\stem{rä}.
Gloss (with missing item): then ___ STSG:SBJ>FSG:OBJ:Rpst:PFV/speak SSG.POSS food EMPH STPL:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be:.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, Bäi's wife said to me ``Your food is here!'' '
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Close possession is also possible with personal names as possessors. In this case, the personal name is treated like a prefix, i.e. it is syllabified together with the \isi{possessed}. This can be seen in example (\ref{ex450}). The \isi{possessor} is the personal name Bäi [{ᵐ}bˈæ͡ı], and the \isi{possessed} is fzenz [ɸˈə̆tse{ⁿ}ts] `wife'. A normal \isi{possessive} construction would add the \isi{possessive} \isi{case} to the \isi{possessor}: Bäiane fzenz [{ᵐ}bˈæjane ɸˈə̆tʃe{ⁿ}ts] `Bäi's wife'. Both words receive \isi{stress} separately, and both are syllabified independently. In the close \isi{possessive} construction, the two words are syllabified as one word: Bäyfzenz [{ᵐ}bˈæjə̆ɸtʃe{ⁿ}ts]. Note that the initial consonant of fzenz is resyllabified as a coda, the epenthentic vowel [ə̆] occurs between the two words, and fzenz does not receive separate \isi{stress}. All this is evidence that the \isi{possessor} (the personal name) is treated like the prefixes described above.
A: word: bäi-fzenz=f	 gloss: bäi-wife=ERG.SG
B: word: menz=f	 gloss: story.man=ERG.SG
C: word: bäi=f	 gloss: bäi=ERG.SG
D: word: nafanme	 gloss: TNSG.POSS

The English translation of this sentence is:`Only from Kowi's husband we will eat (food) ... If Kowi had a husband.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For some items in a close \isi{possessive} construction, there is an /a/ element between \isi{possessor} and \isi{possessed}, as in example (\ref{ex489}) kowi-a-fis `Kowi's husband'. Thus, in these cases there is an overt marker of the close \isi{possessive} construction. The /a/ element seems to be a reduction of the \isi{possessive} \isi{case} marker =ane. The example is taken from a conversation about food taboos. The speaker is joking about his sister \textendash{} a young unmarried woman.\footnote{The fact that in example (\ref{ex489}) the possessive case =ane is encliticised to kowiafis `Kowi's husband' is not relevant for the point here. This always occurs when the characteristic case is attached to an animate referent ({\S}\ref{charcase}).}

The English translation of this sentence is:`He put the arm underneath ... he pulled him from the mud ... he pulled him out ... one arm was like this on the boy ... the other ... with the other he climbed up on the bamboo.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{locative} \isi{case} marker is =en, for example mnz=en `in the house'. If the host word ends in a vowel, the formative is =n, for example mni=n `in the fire'. There are designated formatives for \isi{animate} referents, which make a \isi{singular} versus \isi{non-singular} contrast. Example (\ref{ex431}) shows the \isi{locative} \isi{case} in its basic use. Example (\ref{ex430}) comes from a text about a young boy who drowned in the Morehead river after he got stuck underwater in the mud. The example is a detailed description of how the body was recovered from the river.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The above functions of the \isi{locative} were all at the clausal level. At the interclausal level, the \isi{locative} can also be used with a \isi{nominalisation} as the counterpart of an adverbial subordinator where it encodes an event that occurs simultthe morpheme ___ously with that of the main \isi{clause}.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ tmatm zra\stem{fiyok}wr o ŋatha=fo.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ event STSG:SBJ:IRR:IPFV/make or dog=All.
The English translation of this sentence is:`(The sorcerer) does this to a wallaby or to a dog.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{animate}/\isi{inanimate} distinction mentioned in {\S}\ref{spatialcase} can be used to mark definiteness of \isi{animate} referents, for example animals. In (\ref{ex439}), the speaker points out that sorcerers usually do not attack a person directly, but they put a deadly spell on a person's dog or some other animal. Later, when the animal suffers and dies, the human victim will also die. Thus, in (\ref{ex439}) `the dog' and `the wallaby' are generic, and therefore marked with the (\isi{inanimate}) \isi{allative} \isi{case} marker. In contrast, example (\ref{ex440}) is taken from a story about a dog and a crow. Both have been introduced previously and are known to the speaker as individual characters. Consequently, the dog in (\ref{ex440}) is marked with the \isi{animate} \isi{allative}.\footnote{Unfortunately, there is no corpus example of a referent which undergoes a change from inanimate allative to animate allative when tracked through a discourse.}
A: word: tauri=fo	 gloss: wallaby=All

You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): fi fenz ane ___ \stem{rä} ... tmä yari-si=r.
Gloss (with missing item): but body.liquid DEM ___ TSG.F:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be ... strength give-NMLZ=PURP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`but the body liquid is only for this ... for giving power.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The last noun phrase in (\ref{ex413}) and in (\ref{ex415}) show the \isi{purposive} \isi{case} operating at the interclausal level. In both cases the \isi{purposive} \isi{case} marker is attached to an infinitival adjunct. In (\ref{ex415}), the speaker talks about sorcerers who visit a deceased man's grave after the burial to extract certain body parts. In both examples, the clause marked with the \isi{purposive} contains the infinitive as well as the \isi{object} of the event in the ablative, for example tmä yarisi `strength giving' in (\ref{ex415}).
A: word: bänemr=nzo	 gloss: Recog.PURP=ONLY
B: word: bänemr	 gloss: Recog.PURP
C: word: bäi=nzo	 gloss: bäi=ONLY
D: word: yame	 gloss: mat
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Question 111:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Gloss (with missing item): but body.liquid DEM ___ TSG.F:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be ... strength give-NMLZ=PURP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`but the body liquid is only for this ... for giving power.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The noun phrase or the infinitival adjunct marked with =r ascribes a specific purpose, and in this ascriptive function, the \isi{purposive} overlaps with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case}. Hence, in (\ref{ex415}) both tmä yarisir and tmä yarisima would be grammatical and identical in meaning. I described the nature of this overlap in {\S}\ref{charcase}.
A: word: bänemr=nzo	 gloss: Recog.PURP=ONLY
B: word: bänemr	 gloss: Recog.PURP
C: word: kma	 gloss: Pot
D: word: bi=karä=sü	 gloss: sago=PROP=ETC

Sentence (with missing item): keke thu\stem{fn}zrm ... ___ kar=ma kabe.
Gloss (with missing item): NEG STSG:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:DUR/hit ... ___ village=CHAR man.
The English translation of this sentence is:`She was not killing them ... the people from this village.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} covers a number of semantic roles which are source, reason and purpose. The \isi{characteristic} operates at all three levels: adnominal (\ref{ex419}), clausal (\ref{ex390}) and interclausal (\ref{ex391}). In example (\ref{ex419}), karma `from the village' functions within a matrix \isi{noun phrase}. In this example, the \isi{characteristic} could be left out, and the morpheme ___ karma kabe or the morpheme ___ kar kabe are both grammatical.\footnote{In zthe morpheme ___ kar kabe, the phrasal head consists of a compound kar kabe. In zthe morpheme ___ karma kabe, the noun phrase zthe morpheme ___ kar is embedded in a matrix noun phrase. Thus, the reference of the demonstrative zthe morpheme ___ is different between the two examples. In the former case zthe morpheme ___ refers to the complex head, but in the latter case zthe morpheme ___ refers only to the head of the embedded noun phrase. See {\S}\ref{headslot} for a discussion of noun phrases.} In example (\ref{ex390}), the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} attaches to a separate \isi{noun phrase} and functions at the clause level. In example (\ref{ex391}), the speaker comments on the exhausting work of dragging a sago palm trunk. The \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} attaches to an infinitival adjunct (`dragging') and, thus, operates at a interclausal level.
A: word: ane	 gloss: DEM

You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} competes with the \isi{purposive} \isi{case} in marking the semantic role of purpose. In many utterances, they can be used interchangeably. Consider examples (\ref{ex399}) and (\ref{ex398}), where both can be used to express an inherent purpose of some entity (`the leaf is for rolling cigarettes'). Likewise, in (\ref{ex394}), the \isi{purposive} could be used (kaboth räkumgsir yé `it is for attracting snakes'). An intentional purpose of some individual (e.g. `he goes for hunting') is most frequently expressed by the \isi{purposive} \isi{case}, not by the \isi{characteristic}.

Consider examples (\ref{ex399}) and (\ref{ex398}), where both can be used to express an inherent purpose of some entity (`the leaf is for rolling cigarettes'). Likewise, in (\ref{ex394}), the \isi{purposive} could be used (kaboth räkumgsir yé `it is for attracting snakes'). An intentional purpose of some individual (e.g. `he goes for hunting') is most frequently expressed by the \isi{purposive} \isi{case}, not by the \isi{characteristic}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They gave me their sister as that ... as an exchange woman.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: With \isi{animate} referents, the \isi{dative} is used to mark a \isi{goal} or \isi{beneficiary}. The \isi{purposive} \isi{case} can be used for more abstract \isi{animate} referents, for example fäms ŋare=r `for/as exchange woman'.\footnote{Example (\ref{ex173}) on page \pageref{ex173} provides a textual example of fäms ŋarer.} The \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} cannot serve for marking purpose in this sense. Instead, with \isi{animate} referents it always marks a reason, origin or cause. Additionally, \isi{animate} referents must take the \isi{possessive} \isi{case} first, and then the \isi{characteristic} =ma attaches to the \isi{possessive}. In example (\ref{ex400}), a young man explains how the food will be shared during an upcoming feast. The \isi{characteristic} is attached to the \isi{possessive} pronouns. Example (\ref{ex401}) comes from a story in which the wife of a man had been killed, and at the end of the story he cries bitterly because of her. In both examples, the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} attaches to a \isi{possessive}: nzenmema and nafaŋareanema.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The use the term ``\isi{proprietive}'' for this case enclitic because it constitutes a functional opposition with the private case, i.e. `having something' versus `not having something'. There are two variants for the proprietive =karä and =kaf. They operate at the clausal and interclausal level and express the semantic role of association (`with something' or `with someone') or property (`having some quality', `having some object'). The latter role often employs an existential construction, as in (\ref{ex347}) and (\ref{ex346}). In its semantics, the \isi{proprietive} overlaps with the \isi{associative} \isi{case}. The main difference lies in the kinds of referents encoded. The associative often encodes animate referents, while the proprietive is rarely found with animate referents. See (\ref{ex345}) for one such example. I discuss the difference between the associative and the proprietive in {\S}\ref{comcase}.

Gloss (with missing item): hip IAM FSG:SBJ:Rpst:PFV/hold ... ___ sun STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/see.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He has his hands on his hips. As he looks up at the sun, he laughs.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{proprietive} \isi{case} operates at the interclausal level when it is attached to a nominalised verb (\ref{ex350}). Unlike the instrumental \isi{case}, the \isi{proprietive} does not form a resultative construction. In (\ref{ex350}), the relationship between borsi `laugh' and the predicate `he looks' is one of association or \isi{simultaneity}. It can also be translated as a manner adverbial (`He stands laughingly.'). In example (\ref{ex428}) the father comes while telling a story. In contrast, in resultative constructions, the result of some previous event is emphasised. For example, in (\ref{ex427}) the speaker points to a stack of yams in his storage house stressing the fact that he has piled up different types of yam tubers. This can be analysed as a pseudo-\isi{passive} construction ({\S}\ref{passiveclause}).
A: word: bor-si=karä	 gloss: laugh-NMLZ=PROP

The English translation of this sentence is:`Well, that one is sitting ... he is thinking ... with his hands tied.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: At the clausal level, the \isi{proprietive} can also attach to a nominalised verb. Example (\ref{ex348}) is the description of a picture card which depicts a prisoner sitting in his cell. Example (\ref{ex349}) comes from the same recording, when the prisoner is set free and handed back his belongings. These two examples presuppose some kind of result \textendash{} `has been tied' and `has been opened', respectively \textendash{} but the previous event remains implicit. For example, in (\ref{ex349}) the speaker draws attention to the fact that the door is open with the help of a \isi{demonstrative} \isi{identifier} brä.

In example (\ref{ex353}), the speaker talks about older lineages of his clan. The example contrasts the \isi{proprietive} and the \isi{privative} \isi{case}. The absence (ngemär) or existence (ngekarä) marked on nge `child' relates those noun phrases to fi `they' and bäi, respectively.

It is used to indicate that some entity lacks something (\ref{ex354}), someone (\ref{ex353}) or some quality (\ref{ex355}). The \isi{privative} operates usally at the clausal level. Like the \isi{proprietive} \isi{case}, it can establish a semantic link between two noun phrases, but the two noun phrases do not form a syntactic constituent. In example (\ref{ex353}), the speaker talks about older lineages of his clan. The example contrasts the \isi{proprietive} and the \isi{privative} \isi{case}. The absence (ngemär) or existence (ngekarä) marked on nge `child' relates those noun phrases to fi `they' and bäi, respectively. In the following examples (\ref{ex354} and \ref{ex355}), the noun phrase to which the privative-marked noun phrase links is omitted.
A: word: ŋanz=märe	 gloss: row=PRIV
B: word: nabi=märe	 gloss: bow=PRIV
C: word: zokwasi=mär	 gloss: word=PRIV
D: word: thari-si=ane	 gloss: dig-NMLZ=POSS.SG

The English translation of this sentence is:`I don't want to make a family/clan garden (anymore).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{privative} \isi{case} =mär or =märe expresses the opposite of the \isi{proprietive}.

Gloss (with missing item): TSG.ERG Quot NEG Third.ABS ___ STPL:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be heart where TSG.F:SBJ:NONPAST:IPFV/be.
The English translation of this sentence is:`He said ``No, they do not know where the heart is.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is one lexeme where the \isi{privative} \isi{case} has become lexicalised. The property noun miyatha `knowledge' or `knowledgeable' is used in constructions expressing a positive epistemic state; usually of the structure miyatha worä `I know', literally: `I am with knowledge' or `I am knowledgeable'. The negation of this statement is most commonly done by using the property noun the morpheme ___ `ignorance' or `its gloss ___', which contains miya and an element mr. The latter is a reduced and lexicalised form of the \isi{privative} \isi{case} marker =mär. We can see this in example (\ref{ex356}), which comes from a myth where two brothers are trying to kill a creature by shooting an arrow into its heart.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They cleared the place along both sides ... the policemen with canoes and shotguns ... they were paddling because of crocodiles.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The associative case can operate at the clausal level (\ref{ex337}) or at the interclausal level (\ref{ex336}). Example (\ref{ex336}) is taken from a storyboard picture task where the speaker describes one of the pictures as part of a narration. The \isi{associative} is attached to the nominalised verb thweksi `rejoice' which acts as an infinitival adjunct.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{enclitic} =sü only attaches to either the \isi{associative} or the \isi{proprietive} \isi{case} marker. It is often translated as ``and all'' by my informants. Consider example (\ref{ex477}), in which a speaker reports how he and some of his brothers transported a heavy sago stem with a couple of canoes.
