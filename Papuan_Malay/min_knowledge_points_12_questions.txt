The possessive clauses in (\ref{Example_12.13}) and (\ref{Example_12.14}) encode inalienable possession relations.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \isi{numeral} and \isi{quantifier} clauses, a \isi{numeral} or \isi{quantifier} conveys the main semantic content; again, these predicates receive a static reading.

Semantically, \isi{numeral} and \isi{quantifier} clauses have determining function in that they express specific properties of the subject, namely those of number and quantity, such that ``\textsc{s} is \textsc{num}/\textsc{qt}'' as illustrated in (\ref{Example_12.18}) to (\ref{Example_12.21}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘in this sky there is one moon, but in the calendar there are twelve’ (Lit. ‘the moon (is) one ... it (is) twelve’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In (\ref{Example_12.18}), a husband relates that in a neighboring village a woman gave birth to a snake. His wife contradicts this statement, asserting that it was not its gloss ___ snake but that the \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ were \textitbf{dua} ‘two’. The analysis of the \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ as a \isi{numeral} predicate and not as an adnominal modifier is confirmed by the following fact. In the context of these utterances it is possible to insert existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ between the subject \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ and the predicate \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ which gives the emphatic progressive reading \textitbf{ular ada dua} ‘the snakes were being two’ or ‘the snakes were indeed two’ (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). If \textitbf{ular dua} was a \isi{noun} phrase with the reading of ‘two snakes’, existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ would have to precede or follow the \isi{noun} phrase such that \textitbf{ada ular dua} ‘there were two snakes’ or \textitbf{ular dua ada} ‘the two snakes exist’. In (\ref{Example_12.19}), predicatively used \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ and \textitbf{dua blas} ‘twelve’ convey information about the numeric quantities of their respective subjects \textitbf{bulang} ‘moon’ and \textitbf{de} ‘3\textsc{sg}’. The first clause \textitbf{di langit ini bulang the morpheme ___} cannot be interpreted as a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} (see §\ref{Para_12.4}) in which \textitbf{bulang the morpheme ___} functions as a \isi{noun} phrase which takes the subject slot. Such a reading would imply that there are several moons with the speaker talking about its gloss ___ of them: \textitbf{bulang the morpheme ___} ‘a certain moon’ (see §\ref{Para_5.9.4} for a more detailed discussion of \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’).

Gloss (with missing item): at sky D.PROX month one but at calendar 3SG ___ teens
The English translation of this sentence is:‘in this sky there is one moon, but in the calendar there are twelve’ (Lit. ‘the moon (is) one ... it (is) twelve’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In (\ref{Example_12.18}), a husband relates that in a neighboring village a woman gave birth to a snake. His wife contradicts this statement, asserting that it was not one snake but that the \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ were \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’. The analysis of the \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ as a \isi{numeral} predicate and not as an adnominal modifier is confirmed by the following fact. In the context of these utterances it is possible to insert existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ between the subject \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ and the predicate \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ which gives the emphatic progressive reading \textitbf{ular ada the morpheme ___} ‘the snakes were being its gloss ___’ or ‘the snakes were indeed its gloss ___’ (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). If \textitbf{ular the morpheme ___} was a \isi{noun} phrase with the reading of ‘its gloss ___ snakes’, existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ would have to precede or follow the \isi{noun} phrase such that \textitbf{ada ular the morpheme ___} ‘there were its gloss ___ snakes’ or \textitbf{ular the morpheme ___ ada} ‘the its gloss ___ snakes exist’. In (\ref{Example_12.19}), predicatively used \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ and \textitbf{the morpheme ___ blas} ‘twelve’ convey information about the numeric quantities of their respective subjects \textitbf{bulang} ‘moon’ and \textitbf{de} ‘3\textsc{sg}’. The first clause \textitbf{di langit ini bulang satu} cannot be interpreted as a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} (see §\ref{Para_12.4}) in which \textitbf{bulang satu} functions as a \isi{noun} phrase which takes the subject slot. Such a reading would imply that there are several moons with the speaker talking about one of them: \textitbf{bulang satu} ‘a certain moon’ (see §\ref{Para_5.9.4} for a more detailed discussion of \textitbf{satu} ‘one’).

Sentence (with missing item): di langit ini bulang satu tapi di kalender de dua ___
Gloss (with missing item): at sky D.PROX month one but at calendar 3SG two ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘in this sky there is one moon, but in the calendar there are twelve’ (Lit. ‘the moon (is) one ... it (is) twelve’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In (\ref{Example_12.18}), a husband relates that in a neighboring village a woman gave birth to a snake. His wife contradicts this statement, asserting that it was not one snake but that the \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ were \textitbf{dua} ‘two’. The analysis of the \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ as a \isi{numeral} predicate and not as an adnominal modifier is confirmed by the following fact. In the context of these utterances it is possible to insert existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ between the subject \textitbf{ular} ‘snake’ and the predicate \textitbf{dua} ‘two’ which gives the emphatic progressive reading \textitbf{ular ada dua} ‘the snakes were being two’ or ‘the snakes were indeed two’ (see also §\ref{Para_5.4.1}). If \textitbf{ular dua} was a \isi{noun} phrase with the reading of ‘two snakes’, existential \textitbf{ada} ‘exist’ would have to precede or follow the \isi{noun} phrase such that \textitbf{ada ular dua} ‘there were two snakes’ or \textitbf{ular dua ada} ‘the two snakes exist’. In (\ref{Example_12.19}), predicatively used \textitbf{satu} ‘one’ and \textitbf{dua the morpheme ___} ‘twelve’ convey information about the numeric quantities of their respective subjects \textitbf{bulang} ‘moon’ and \textitbf{de} ‘3\textsc{sg}’. The first clause \textitbf{di langit ini bulang satu} cannot be interpreted as a \isi{prepositional predicate clause} (see §\ref{Para_12.4}) in which \textitbf{bulang satu} functions as a \isi{noun} phrase which takes the subject slot.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Simulative predicates are formed with prepositions encoding comparisons, that is, similative \textitbf{sperti} ‘similar to’ and \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ and equative \textitbf{sebagey} ‘as’ (see also §\ref{Para_10.3}). In (\ref{Example_12.32}) \textitbf{sperti} ‘similar to’ establishes a simulative relation between the figure \textitbf{de} ‘3\textsc{sg}’ and the ground \textitbf{Sofia}. Along similar lines, \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ denotes a simulative relation between the figure \textitbf{de} ‘\textsc{sg}’ and the ground \textitbf{de pu bapa} ‘his father’ / \textitbf{Siduas} in (\ref{Example_12.33}).
