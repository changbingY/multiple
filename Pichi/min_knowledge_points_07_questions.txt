These clauses differ from verbal clauses and predicate adjective clauses involving the copula dé ‘\textsc{be.loc}’ in two ways: Pronominal subjects are always from the emphatic series \REF{ex:key:524}, and more often than not, the \textsc{3sg} and \textsc{3pl} pronouns remain unexpressed \REF{ex:key:525} because na and the morpheme ___ incorporate \textsc{3sg} reference by default:

For example, in \REF{ex:key:758}, the topicality of the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___(ren)’ is signalled by náw ‘now’ and an intonation break. However, the “resumptive” pronoun e ‘\textsc{3sg.sbj}’ does not refer to the topical syntactic subject the morpheme ___.

Instead, e ‘\textsc{3sg.sbj}’ refers to a concept as a whole, namely procreation, which is loosely referred to by the topic pikín:

B: word: nátín	 gloss: nothing
C: word: áfta	 gloss: then
D: word: gran-pá	 gloss: grand-pa

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.POSS father ___ Chinese
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Her father is Chinese.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The two asymmetries in the formation of copula clauses next to negative suppletion (i.e. \ref{ex:key:767} and \textsc{3sg} default reference, i.e. \ref{ex:key:766} and \ref{ex:key:768}) are complemented by a third asymmetry: Whenever overt \textsc{TMA} marking is required or the copula is employed in a context suggesting reduced finiteness\is{finiteness}, the copula verb bí \textit{\textsc{‘be’}} is made use of. This complementary distribution is strict. Therefore, a clause like the following one is ungrammatical, since bí may not appear in basic identity clauses without overt TMA marking. Compare \REF{ex:key:768} above and \REF{ex:key:770} below:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘They’re called, there is no word (for that) in Pichi.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Existential clauses featuring gɛ́t are not often negated. The data contains only a single negative gɛ́t-existential clause, presented in \REF{ex:key:811}.

A: word: nó	 gloss: NEG
B: word: nóto	 gloss: NEG.FOC
C: word: nɛ́a	 gloss: NEG.PRF
D: word: pero	 gloss: but

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same applies to TMA marking. While quite a few dé-existentials are found with overt TMA marking as in \REF{ex:key:815}, there is no such example of a gɛ́t-existential. The latter type of existential therefore appears to be prototypical in an additional sense – gɛ́t existentials typically predicate a generic situation, which is also marked as such by factative{\fff} tense-aspect:
A: word: bin	 gloss: PST
B: word: íbin	 gloss: evening

Question 583:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Tidé di húman ___ fáyn.
Gloss (with missing item): today DEF woman ___ fine
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Today the woman is fine.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:830}, fáyn ‘be fine’ is used as an adjective and denotes a physical property, namely a body state in an intransitive clause. The predicate adjective construction featuring the copula the morpheme ___ translates as ‘be fine, well, healthy’. Contrast this meaning with \REF{ex:key:831}, where fáyn is employed as an inchoative-stative verb with the meaning ‘be intrinsically fine’ hence ‘beautiful’. In the latter example, fáyn therefore denotes a value:
A: word: dé	 gloss: BE.LOC

C: word: ser	 gloss: be
D: word: dɔ́kta	 gloss: doctor

For example, the property item bráyt ‘be bright, glowing with beauty’ is attested as an adjective where it denotes a visible body state as in \REF{ex:key:832} – the speaker is an elderly lady giving an account of her youth. Compare frɛ́s ‘be fresh’ in the same sentence, which is used as an inchoative-stative verb to denote a more lasting body state of freshness or youthfulness:
