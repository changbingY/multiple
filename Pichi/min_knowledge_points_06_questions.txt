You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Ɛ́ni sáy wé pɔ́sin ___ sidɔ́n, dɛn de sidɔ́n.
Gloss (with missing item): every side SUB person ___ stay 3PL IPFV stay
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Anywhere that a person wanted to stay, they stayed.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since stative verbs have no inherent boundaries, the unmarked stative verb receives an imperfective, i.e. present tense or present state reading \REF{ex:key:315}. Tense is relational in Pichi, so a stative verb like the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is in the present tense in relation to “event time” (\citealt{ChungTimberlake1985}), which is past tense in this example:
A: word: wánt	 gloss: want
B: word: wántɛn	 gloss: suddenly
C: word: quiero	 gloss: I.want
D: word: dɔ́n	 gloss: PRF

You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): \MakeUppercase{A} ___ sɔn kápinta dɛn.
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ ___ some carpenter PL
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I know some carpenters.’ or ‘I got to know some carpenters.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given the right context, all factative-marked inchoative-stative verbs may be interpreted as stative or inchoative (hence denoting entry-into-state). While the morpheme ___ ‘(get to) its gloss ___’ in \REF{ex:key:316} may be interpreted as either stative or inchoative in the absence of disambiguating cues, an inchoative reading is forced upon the factative marked verb évi ‘be heavy’ in \REF{ex:key:317}. This is due to the presence of a relational element, namely the temporal clause linker bifó ‘before’, which induces an implicit comparison with the prior empty state of the bag:
A: word: sabí	 gloss: know
B: word: bíl	 gloss: build
C: word: entiende	 gloss: understand
D: word: kúk	 gloss: cook

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given the right context, all factative-marked inchoative-stative verbs may be interpreted as stative or inchoative (hence denoting entry-into-state). While sabí ‘(get to) know’ in \REF{ex:key:316} may be interpreted as either stative or inchoative in the absence of disambiguating cues, an inchoative reading is forced upon the factative marked verb évi ‘be heavy’ in \REF{ex:key:317}. This is due to the presence of a relational element, namely the temporal clause linker the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’, which induces an implicit comparison with the prior empty state of the bag:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:375}, the main clause is also marked for past tense.

Yet there is no additional past tense marking in the subordinate clause, and indeed, it would be ungrammatical. This in spite of the fact that both the main clause and the subordinate clause are set in the past from the vantage point of the speaker. Hence, the event in the main clause, not speech time, is the reference point for the tense assignment of the subordinate clause:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Yesterday night, when I was calling you, yesterday night, not this morning.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A second manifestation of relational tense in Pichi is the absence of explicit tense marking whenever context offers enough information on tense anchoring. Contextual information may be provided by time adverbials as in \REF{ex:key:376}. Here, the morpheme ___ náyt ‘its gloss ___ night’ anchors time reference in the past. Consequently, the imperfective marked verb kɔ́l ‘call’ receives a present tense/simultaneous interpretation in relation to past tense anchoring. Further marking by bin is unnecessary, although possible (cf. \sectref{sec:6.5.2}):

In this function, the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pst}’ is diametrically opposed to the narrative perfective marker kán ‘\textsc{pfv}’. It should therefore come as no surprise that the morpheme ___ has a default imperfective reading next to its function as a past tense marker. Consider sentence \REF{ex:key:381}:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Secondly, past tense may be explicitly marked by means of the past marker the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pst’}, which encodes relational past tense. Bin is not obligatory in clauses with past reference. Instead, its use depends on discourse-pragmatic factors. The past marker is generally employed in temporally remote, backgrounded, orienting, and supportive sections of narratives. In this function, the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pst}’ is diametrically opposed to the narrative perfective marker kán ‘\textsc{pfv}’. It should therefore come as no surprise that the morpheme ___ has a default imperfective reading next to its function as a past tense marker. Consider sentence \REF{ex:key:381}:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The beginning of narratives anchored in the past very often features the past marker the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pst}’ in the “orientation” section (cf. \citealt[358]{Labov1972}) characterised by aspect marking of the imperfective domain (hence imperfective and/or habitual\is{habitual aspect} aspect). In this, the past marker is true to its role as a device for backgrounding situations and contributing a sense of temporal remoteness. For similar observations on cognate forms of the morpheme ___, see \citet[398]{Winford2000} for \ili{Sranan} and \citet[63]{Pollard1989} Jamaican Creole. The marker the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{pst}’ fulfills this dual function in the orientation section (\ref{ex:key:456b}–e) of the excerpt of a personal narrative below.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: An SVC can express comparison \REF{ex:key:467} on its own. However, the adverb of degree mɔ́ ‘more’ is equally often employed in addition to pás to form a “mixed comparative” \citep{Stassen1985}. The adverb mɔ́ ‘more’ functions as an intensifier, albeit highly conventionalised in its use, rather than being an indispensable element of the comparative construction. It exhibits word order\is{word order} flexibility and may occur after \REF{ex:key:471} or before \REF{ex:key:472} the parameter verb:
A: word: día	 gloss: be.expensive
B: word: judías	 gloss: bean.PL
