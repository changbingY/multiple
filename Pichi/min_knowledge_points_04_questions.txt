Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Human propensities are divided between inchoative-stative (e.g. gudhát ‘be good-hearted’, wíkɛd ‘be wicked’, badhát ‘be mean’, klɛ́va ‘be clever’) and dynamic verbs (e.g. gládin ‘be glad’, jɛ́lɔs ‘be envious’) according to whether they denote intrinsic or transient properties. Resultatives{\fff} are exclusively expressed through the stative readings of labile change-of-state verbs (e.g. brók ‘break, be broken’, chɛ́r ‘tear, be torn’, lɔ́s ‘lose, be lost’ and wɛ́r ‘be dressed’). Semantic types like position or location are expressed through other means, such as copula clauses featuring the locative-existential copula dé (cf. e.g. \ref{ex:key:793}–\ref{ex:key:794}) in combination with adverbials, or through locative verbs like {\fff}lé ‘lie’ and tínap ‘stand (up)’ (cf. \sectref{sec:8.1.3}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘(Then she) became pregnant, (and) began lamenting and lamenting.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Compounding through tone deletion also characterises the reduplication of dynamic verbs in order to derive verbal number \REF{ex:key:100}. This kind of derivation is fully productive for all dynamic verbs. Equally, it can be observed with a small number of lexicalised reduplications involving other word classes (cf. \sectref{sec:4.5.3}):
A: word: hala-hála	 gloss: RED.CPD-shout
B: word: hála	 gloss: shout

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SBJ IPFV PRF pass long time NEG.FOC ___ REP time
The English translation of this sentence is:‘It happened long ago, not very long ago.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \is{cardinal numerals}The meanings of these expressions are semantically distinct from the meanings of their components in varying degrees. The degree of semantic opaqueness of each collocation is reflected in the orthographic choice of writing them as single or separate words. A good indicator of the degree of semantic unity of the collocations in \REF{ex:key:103} is their behaviour during repetition\is{repetition} for emphasis (cf. \ref{ex:key:152} further below). Even in the lexicalised expressions (e.g. bádtɛn ‘unfortunately) each morpheme nevertheless retains its original pitch, as shown by tone marking. This renders complex words with a sequence of two H tones (the second H undergoes downstep).
A: word: lɔ́n	 gloss: long

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:104}, the dynamic verb hála ‘shout’ is used as a dynamic noun or “action nominal”, (\citealt{ComrieThompson1985}). In \REF{ex:key:105}, the inchoative-stative verb gúd ‘be good’ is employed as a stative noun or “state nominal” (\citealt{ComrieThompson1985}). The use of nominalised verbs as cognate objects \is{cognate objects}is common for emphasis (cf. \sectref{sec:9.3.3}). Cognate objects\is{objects} behave no differently from other nominalised verbs:
A: word: dán	 gloss: that

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.SBJ fear QUOT 3PL POT ___ 1SG.POSS child PREP 1SG.INDP
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I feared that they could impregnate me my child.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In contrast, very few nouns are attested in the syntactic position of verbs. The noun the morpheme ___ ‘belly’ \REF{ex:key:107} may be used as a verb with the meaning ‘its gloss ___’ \REF{ex:key:108}. Other noun-verb pairs in the corpus that may be employed in a similar way are kaká ‘defecate, faeces’, pipí ‘urinate, urine’, rút ‘root, uproot’, latrín ‘toilet, go to toilet’. These rare cases are not listed in \tabref{tab:key:4.3} because they are lexicalised, and there is hence no productive noun-verb conversion.

Gloss (with missing item): this girl child ___ SP
The English translation of this sentence is:‘This girl is really too lean.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A verb may appear as the head of a compound featuring the multifunctional word óva ‘over, be excessive, too much’ as the first component. The resulting compound verb expresses an excessive degree of the situation denoted by the verb. It is therefore normally formed with verbs denoting properties, such as dráy ‘be dry, lean’ \REF{ex:key:127}, or verbs whose meaning contains an implicit gradation, such as dríng ‘drink (alcohol)’ \REF{ex:key:128}.
A: word: ova-dráy	 gloss: over.CPD-be.dry

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Me and Rubi, we joined up, we bought avocados, we bought sardines, we bought tomatoes, we had breakfast.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Further, the interaction of verbal and nominal plurality often characterises the use of iterative aspect. The presence of plural referents generally induces a sense of iterative-distributive action of the situation denoted by the verb. For example, the light verb construction in \REF{ex:key:140} features the reduplicated nominalised verb jwɛ́n ‘join’. The presence of the plural subject mí wet Rubi ‘me and Rubi’, which is picked up by the resumptive pronoun{\fff} wi ‘\textsc{1pl}’, induces a cumulative meaning of the reduplicated and deverbal noun jwɛ́n ‘join’:

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG.INDP with NAME 1PL make ___ 1PL buy avocado 1PL buy sardine 1PL buy tomatoes 1PL breakfast
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Me and Rubi, we joined up, we bought avocados, we bought sardines, we bought tomatoes, we had breakfast.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Further, the interaction of verbal and nominal plurality often characterises the use of iterative aspect. The presence of plural referents generally induces a sense of iterative-distributive action of the situation denoted by the verb. For example, the light verb construction in \REF{ex:key:140} features the reduplicated nominalised verb jwɛ́n ‘join’. The presence of the plural subject mí wet Rubi ‘me and Rubi’, which is picked up by the resumptive pronoun{\fff} wi ‘\textsc{1pl}’, induces a cumulative meaning of the reduplicated and deverbal noun jwɛ́n ‘join’:
A: word: jwɛn-jwɛ́n	 gloss: RED.CPD-join
B: word: jwɛ́n	 gloss: join
C: word: quince	 gloss: fifteen
D: word: ova-dráy	 gloss: over.CPD-be.dry

Sentence (with missing item): Dɛn kin de ___ dɛn sɛ́f kɔ́tlas ó.
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL HAB IPFV ___ 3PL self cutlass SP
The English translation of this sentence is:‘(Mind you) they have the habit of chopping each other up with cutlasses.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The iterative-distributive sense of the reduplicated verb is particularly evident in a reciprocal{\fff} construction like \REF{ex:key:142}. We have seen that a single form, the pronominal sɛ́f ‘self, \textsc{emp}’ is employed as both the reflexive{\fff} and reciprocal anaphor. Hence there is room for ambiguity between the reflexive and reciprocal senses when a clause features a plural subject. One disambiguating feature amongst others is the presence of a reduplicated verb. There is no formal feature contained in \REF{ex:key:142} that would categorically force a reciprocal interpretation on the clause. But the use of reduplication, the presence of plural referents, and the meaning of the verb cháp ‘chop’ and its instrument{\fff} object kɔ́tlas ‘cutlass’ collude to induce a reciprocal rather than a reflexive meaning of the clause:
A: word: chap-cháp	 gloss: RED.CPD-chop

The English translation of this sentence is:‘He said he wanted to come move around a little in Equatorial Guinea.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:key:143}, the intransitive use of the reduplicated verb tɔ́n ‘turn’, in concert with the singular subject e ‘\textsc{3sg.sbj}’, favours the related readings of low intensity or casualness. Further examples for these nuances are the reduplication of rɔ́b ‘rub’ in \REF{ex:key:138} above, and of táyt ‘tighten’ in \REF{ex:key:145} below. All these examples may also be seen to involve a nuance of lack of control by the subject:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘I coming from town right now.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Repetition produces a range of emphatic, intensifying nuances. The core meaning of repetition is augmentative, hence an iconic “more of the same”. However, the expression of plural number does not lie within the functional range of repetition. In the following three examples, we witness the use of intensifying repetition for emphasis with the temporal adverb the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ \REF{ex:key:146}, the locative noun dɔ́n ‘down’ \REF{ex:key:147}, the common noun fámbul ‘family’, and the attributively used property item bɔkú ‘(be) much’ \REF{ex:key:148}:

In \REF{ex:key:155} and \REF{ex:key:156} above, bíg and the morpheme ___ undergo repetition, not reduplication. Although this example stands alone, it may be indicative of an area of transition between reduplication and repetition not only in meaning but also in form.
A: word: smɔ́l	 gloss: REP
B: word: smɔ́ltɛn	 gloss: shortly
C: word: diplomático	 gloss: diplomatic
D: word: gúd	 gloss: good
