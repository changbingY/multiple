The English translation of this sentence is:‘They look for a puppy that hasn’t opened its eyes yet.’ (lit. a dog closing eyes)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We consider that the adjectiviser is a separate phonological word with semantic scope over the preceding noun phrase.\footnote{\citet{Bow1997c} called this morpheme a noun affix. Also, for simple adjectivised noun constructions, speakers consider the adjectiviser to be part of the same word as the noun that is modified. However, in the absence of evidence for phonological bondedness, we consider the morpheme ___ to be a separate phonological word.} The adjectiviser maintains its position at the right edge of a noun phrase rethe morpheme ___rdless of the noun phrase components (\ref{ex:5:44}--\ref{ex:5:49}). This fact indicates that it might be a clitic. However, we find no undisputable evidence that it is phonologically bound to the noun. Example \REF{ex:5:42} shows noun-final changes /n/ → [ŋ] before the morpheme ___. These changes might be due to assimilation of /n/ to point of articulation of /g/ within a word (see \sectref{sec:2.2}). However, the same change would occur at a word break, with word-final changes to /n/ (see \sectref{sec:2.2.4} and \sectref{sec:2.6.1.2}).\footnote{We have not no examples of word-final alterations of /h/ before the morpheme ___.} Also, the prosody of the morpheme ___ does not neutralise any prosody on the word to which it is bound.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The head noun of the relative clause can be either the subject or the direct object of the relative clause. When the head noun is the subject of the relative clause (\refits gloss ___ex:5:99}--\refits gloss ___ex:5:102}), there is a gap for subject in the relative clause (marked by Ø in the examples). For example, the understood subject of the relative clause in \REFits gloss ___ex:5:99} is the same as war dalay ‘the girl’ in the noun phrase. In the example, the Ø is a zero marking where the subject of the clause would otherwise be. There is a gap for subject because the subject of the relative clause is the same as the head of the noun phrase that is being modified.

It is interesting that this subject pronoun of the relative clause is sometimes a free pronoun (\ref{ex:5:104}, \ref{ex:5:105}, \ref{ex:5:109}, see \sectref{sec:3.1.1}) but in other cases is a possessive pronoun (\ref{ex:5:103}, see \sectref{sec:3.1.2}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘They set fire to the house that the others had made.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the head noun is the direct object of the relative clause, the relative clause must contain a subject pronoun. The pronoun must be inserted before the verb in the relative clause (\ref{ex:5:103}--\ref{ex:5:105}). It is interesting that this subject pronoun of the relative clause is sometimes a free pronoun (\ref{ex:5:104}, \ref{ex:5:105}, \ref{ex:5:109}, see \sectref{sec:3.1.1}) but in other cases is a possessive pronoun (\ref{ex:5:103}, see \sectref{sec:3.1.2}). Two examples from the same narrative\footnote{The entire narrative is not included in this work.} (\ref{ex:5:103} and \ref{ex:5:104}) use different pronouns for the subject of the relative clause. While \REF{ex:5:103} uses the \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{p} possessive pronoun ata, \REF{ex:5:104} uses the free pronoun təta. In some cases, the relative clause will contain the direct object pronominal na following the dependent verb. The \DO pronominal represents the noun phrase head. In the examples below, the direct object pronominal na is underlined. A gap for the direct object in the relative clause (\ref{ex:5:104} and \ref{ex:5:109}) is indicated by {Ø}.

You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Sentence (with missing item): [Ø ___ dəraj na] waj
Gloss (with missing item): { ___ head PSP who
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Who will win?’ (lit. the one to carry the head, who?)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In all of the above examples, the head noun can be modified by other modifiers in addition to the relative clause. Sometimes, however, the relative clause itself is the entire noun phrase (\ref{ex:5:107}--\ref{ex:5:108}). These noun phrases that consist of relative clauses take no other noun phrase modifiers. Also, they are apparently limited in the type of clause construction in which they can occur. They can only be the predicate of a larger predicate nominal construction (see \sectref{sec:10.1.2}). Examples \REF{ex:5:107} and \REF{ex:5:108} are interrogative constructions with a predicate nominal structure (see \sectref{sec:10.3.1}). We found no natural examples where a headless relative clause served as a matrix component in a matrix verbal clause. Example \REF{ex:5:108} is an emphatic construction (see \sectref{sec:10.3.5}).
