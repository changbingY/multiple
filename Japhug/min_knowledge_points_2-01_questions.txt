Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): tɕè ___ cì pjɤ-tú-ndʑi tɕè tɤ-rʑáβ nɯ̀ ɬamú pjɤ-rmí. tɤ-tɕɯ́ nɯ̀ tsʰɯráŋ pjɤ-rmí.
Gloss (with missing item): LNK ___ INDEF IFR.IPFV-exist-DU LNK INDEF.POSS-wife DEM ANTHR IPFV.IPFV-be.called INDEF.POSS-son DEM ANTHR IPFV.IPFV-be.called
The English translation of this sentence is:`There was a couple, the wife was called Lhamo, and the man Tshering.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The clearest phonological criterion for wordhood is stress. Stress is by default word-final, and words have at most one stress. Most function words, including linkers (§\ref{sec:coordination}), determiners (§\ref{sec:determiners}), postpositions (§\ref{ex:postpositions}) and even relator nouns (§\ref{sec:relator.nouns}) lack stress (unless they receive special emphasis). In example (\ref{ex:clitics.words}), the stressed syllables are indicated by an acute accent, and the unstressed function words by a grave accent.
A: word: ʁzɤmí	 gloss: couple
B: word: ʁzɤmi	 gloss: couple
C: word: tɤrcɯrca	 gloss: together
D: word: tɤ-rʑáβ	 gloss: INDEF.POSS-wife
