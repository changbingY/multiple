Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Finally, existential clauses are negated with negative existential the morpheme ___. Examples~(\ref{exe:sorthe morpheme ___}) and~(\ref{exe:the morpheme ___}) show existential negation. Saerak is the opposite of existential mambon, as shown in example~(\ref{exe:mamsae}). It is ungrammatical to combine either mambon or the morpheme ___ with negator =nin. Saerak has a slightly more differentiated use than mambon. For non-possession, the morpheme ___ is obligatory, whereas for affirmative possessive clauses mambon only stresses the presence of a possessed item, but is not necessary to express possession.
A: word: saerak	 gloss: NEG_EXIST
B: word: go_saerak=ko	 gloss: place-NEG_EXIST=LOC
C: word: bolon	 gloss: little
D: word: ∅=nin	 gloss: give=NEG
