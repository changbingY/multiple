Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The class 17 locative ku- can be used to mark an agent in a construction where an agent cannot be marked as a core argument. This is the case, for instance, for verbs with the passive derivation, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref450665409}), or nouns, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref450665567}). The class 17 prefix ku- may also be used to express less canonical agents, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref450666359}), or even peripheral arguments functioning as a reason or circumstance, rather than an agent, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref498346503}). The agentive use of the class 17 prefix is also seen in various other Bantu languages \citep{Fleisch2005}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The tonal realization of demonstratives depends on their syntactic position. Adnominal demonstratives have a high tone on the last mora of the stem, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref494890604}). Adverbial demonstratives have a high tone on the first stem mora, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref494890605}).

This can be applied to demonstratives of all four series, as illustrated for series III in (\ref{bkm:Ref99547938}) and series I in (\ref{bkm:Ref99547939}); in each case, it is the basic demonstrative stem of series I that is prefixed to the demonstrative stem.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Because of this story of the elephants…’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Demonstratives also have various non-situational uses. One of these is the use of a demonstrative for discourse deixis, i.e. to refer to the general information referent of a larger, broader chunk of discourse. In (\ref{bkm:Ref437947332}), the series III demonstrative èryó ‘that’ refers back to the topic of the preceding discourse in its entirety, which has described the attack on an old lady by elephants.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ NP1-man PP1-INF-take-FV NP12-axe
The English translation of this sentence is:‘That man took an axe…’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Salience, or accessibility \citep{Ariel2001}, describes how easy it is for the listener to retrieve the intended referent from the discourse. Accessibility is influenced by various factors, such as the number of times the referent was mentioned, the time elapsed since the last mention and the number of potentially competing referents that were introduced since then. In (\ref{bkm:Ref437948356}), the recent use of the word mùnzì ‘village’ has caused its referent to be highly salient, and therefore referred to with the series III demonstrative. An example where the frequent earlier mention of the referent has contributed to its salience is given in (\ref{bkm:Ref437948827}), taken from the middle section of a longer narrative in which a man, his wife and the wife’s younger sister are the main participants. All three main characters have been mentioned frequently in the previous discourse, hence allowing one of them, the man, to be referred to with the series III demonstrative.

When the dependent is a noun that cannot take an augment, the vowel of the connective stem is always /a/, in both Namibian and Zambian Fwe. This is the case with proper names, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref492119044}), and adverbs, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref491175346}). The vowel of the connective is also realized as a when used with a demonstrative pronoun, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref71190780}--\ref{bkm:Ref71190782}), as opposed to when the connective is used with an adnominal demonstrative, in which case the vowel of the connective is determined by the augment of the demonstrative; see (\ref{bkm:Ref491276208}--\ref{bkm:Ref491276210}).
