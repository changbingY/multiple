Which marker is employed depends upon speaker assessment. If the presupposition marker na delimits the condition (\ref{ex:12:42}--\ref{ex:12:44}), the clause is neutral with respect to whether the speaker expects the condition to be fulfilled or not. In the examples of this section, both the subordinating conjunction and presupposition or ‘unexpected’ information marker are bolded, and the subordinate clause is delimited by square brackets.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Many clauses in a Moloko discourse are independent and are not linked grammatically to a preceding or following clause by a connector or by the presupposition marker na. The semantic nature of the connection between these unmarked, \nohyphens{juxtaposed} clauses is inferred from the context.\footnote{The presupposition marker na aids in making a connection between two clauses, because it makes it explicit that the first (na{}-marked) clause is known information. Na constructions have already been discussed in \sectref{sec:11.1}.} A juxtaposed clause can simply re-express the thought in the first clause. In \REF{ex:12:62}, the second clause restates in the negative that God is near. In \REF{ex:12:63}, the second clause makes more precise the general instruction in the first clause. In \REF{ex:12:64}, the second clause expands on what the speaker sees about the chief. In the examples in this section, each clause is delimited by square brackets and the juxtaposed clause is bolded.
