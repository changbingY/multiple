Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___
Gloss (with missing item): ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I did.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \largerpage \citet{Bow1997c} found that a prosody on the verb stem will spread leftwards from the verb stem over the singular subject prefixes. The fact that palatalisation and labialisation spread over the subject prefixes indicates that the subject markers are fully bound to the verb stem and are not separate words. \REF{ex:7:11} presents the palatalised verb /g\textsuperscript{ e}/ ‘do,’ and \REF{ex:7:12} presents the labialised verb /l\textsuperscript{o}/ ‘go.’
A: word: nɛ-g-ɛ	 gloss: oneS-do-CL
B: word: tɛ-g-ɛ	 gloss: 3P-do-CL
C: word: nə-ɗəgal-aj	 gloss: oneS-think-CL

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \largerpage \citet{Bow1997c} found that a prosody on the verb stem will spread leftwards from the verb stem over the singular subject prefixes. The fact that palatalisation and labialisation spread over the subject prefixes indicates that the subject markers are fully bound to the verb stem and are not separate words. \REF{ex:7:11} presents the palatalised verb /g\textsuperscript{ e}/ ‘do,’ and \REF{ex:7:12} presents the labialised verb /l\textsuperscript{o}/ ‘go.’

Sentence (with missing item): ___
Gloss (with missing item): ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘I stand.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \citet{Bow1997c} also discovered that labialisation on the {\oneP} and {\twoP} subject suffixes will spread leftwards from the suffix onto the entire verb word. This fact indicates that these morphemes are fully bound to the verb stem and are not separate words. The verb /ts k-j\textsuperscript{e}/ ‘stand’, shown in example \REF{ex:7:13} in its {\oneS} form, loses its palatalisation and becomes labialised when the (labialised) plural\is{Plurality!Verb plurals|)} suffixes are added \REF{ex:7:14}:
A: word: nɛ-tʃɪk-ɛ	 gloss: oneS-stand-CL
B: word: tʃɪk-ɛ	 gloss: stand[twoS.IMP]-CL

Sentence (with missing item): ___ awak
Gloss (with missing item): ___ goat
The English translation of this sentence is:‘You slay the goat for him.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The fact that the indirect object pronominal can attach to verb stems as well as other particles confirms that it is in fact a clitic pronoun. Normally, the indirect object pronominal enclitic attaches directly to the verb stem \REF{ex:7:24}. However, if the plural subject pronominal suffix is required on the verb \REF{ex:7:25}, the indirect object pronominal can no longer attach to the verb, because the verb stem can take only one suffix (see \sectref{sec:7.1}). Instead, the indirect object pronominal cliticises to the particle an. This particle may be related to ana, the dative preposition ‘to.’
A: word: ka-ɬ=aŋ	 gloss: twoS-slay=3S.IO
B: word: ta-ɬ=aw	 gloss: 3P-kill=oneS.IO

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Maybe we won’t be destroyed after all.’\footnote{Note that this ‘passive’ idea (to be destroyed) is accomplished through the flexible transitivity system in Moloko\is{Transitivity!Clauses with zero transitivity}. The verb means ‘destroy’ but with the Theme as subject of the verb, the whole clause here expresses a passive idea (\chapref{chap:9}). }
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: High tone followed by low tone on the lengthened subject prefix indicates Possible mood (an action is desired by the speaker but dependent on the will of another, \ref{ex:7:71}--\ref{ex:7:74}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘They played another trick.’ (lit. they did trick ‘on top’ [of when they did it before])
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Adpositional extensions are phonological enclitics at the right edge of the verb. \citet{FriesenMamalis2008} showed them to be phonologically bound to the verb stem because the /-j/ suffix drops off when the clitic attaches \REF{ex:7:95} (see also \sectref{sec:6.3}). Compare \REF{ex:7:94} and \REF{ex:7:95} which illustrate the verb /g -j \textsuperscript{e}/ ‘do.’ Note that the /-j/ suffix in the stem drops off when the extension =aka is attached \REF{ex:7:95}. Another piece of evidence that the extension is phonologically bound to the verb stem is that the palatisation of the verb stem is neutralised by the extension. There is no adpositional extension and the verb word is palatalised in \REF{ex:7:94}, whereas in \REF{ex:7:95} the locational extension =aka has neutralised the prosody of the entire verb complex.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ ID:full
The English translation of this sentence is:‘It had filled right to the rim.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another piece of evidence that the extensions are phonologically attached to the verb stem is that the word-final allophones of /n/ and /h/, that is [ŋ] and [x], respectively, do not occur in the word-final position in the verb word when the locational is attached. When the extension =va cliticises to the verb /r h/ ‘fill,’ word-final alterations of /h/ do not occur \REF{ex:7:96}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The adpositional does not cliticise to the verb in \REF{ex:7:97} and \REF{ex:7:98} since the indirect object pronominal enclitic and plural subject suffix both trigger a word-final boundary (see \sectref{sec:7.1}), rendering the adpositional in a separate phonological word.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Come even still closer.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The extension =aka ‘on’ or ‘on top of’ also has the metaphorical meaning of ‘in addition to,’ ‘again,’ or ‘even still’ when the action of the verb occurs ‘on top of’ something that occurred previously; compare the following pair of examples, and note how the =aka in \REF{ex:7:100} looks backward to another instance of the same action in \REF{ex:7:99}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Like the adpositionals, the directionals are phonological clitics at the right edge of the verbal complex. The presence of the enclitics requires that the /-j/ suffix be dropped off (the verb stem in example \REF{ex:7:104} is /dzap -j/ ‘mix’). The neutral prosody of these extensions causes the palatalisation on the verb stem to neutralise. In \REF{ex:7:107} the verb stem is / nz -j \textsuperscript{e}/ ‘go’ with a \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} surface form of [ɛnʒɛ].

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Unlike the other extensions, the Perfect enclitic has two possible positions in the verb phrase.

In (\ref{ex:7:124}--\ref{ex:7:127}, \ref{ex:7:131}), =va follows the adpositional and directional extensions in the verb complex and precedes other elements in the verb phrase. In \REF{ex:7:129} and \REF{ex:7:132}, =va occurs at the end of the clause, a rarer construction that presumably occurs to underscore the idea that the event is already finished.

In the other constructions (\ref{ex:7:161}--\ref{ex:7:162}), the second noun represents the direct object of the nominalised verb.
