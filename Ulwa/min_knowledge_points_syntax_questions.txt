Gloss (with missing item): ah 1SG-POSS child PL.DIST ___ eat-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`Ah, what will my children eat?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As mentioned in \sectref{sec:8.3.2}, the \isi{question word}s the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___?’ and ango ‘which?’ likely derive from the \isi{negation} marker ango ‘\textsc{neg}’. This may suggest that content questions in general may derive from \isi{polar question}s (e.g., a \isi{question} like ‘its gloss ___ will my children eat?’ in \REF{ex:syntax:10} would have its origin in something like ‘will my children not eat?’).\footnote{Similarly, \isi{interrogative pronoun}s like kwa ‘who? [\textsc{sg]}’ and kuma ‘who? [\textsc{nsg]}’ are \isi{colexified} with \isi{indefinite pronoun}s. Thus, content questions such as the one in \REF{ex:syntax:13} may thus derive from \isi{polar question}s (i.e., ‘who is carrying it?’ < ‘is someone carrying it?’).}

Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3SG.OBJ=take walk-IPFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`Who is carrying it around?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As mentiits gloss ___d in \sectref{sec:8.3.2}, the \isi{question word}s angos ‘what?’ and ango ‘which?’ likely derive from the \isi{negation} marker ango ‘\textsc{neg}’. This may suggest that content questions in general may derive from \isi{polar question}s (e.g., a \isi{question} like ‘what will my children eat?’ in \REF{ex:syntax:10} would have its origin in something like ‘will my children not eat?’).\footnote{Similarly, \isi{interrogative pronoun}s like kwa ‘who?

Gloss (with missing item): ___ again 3SG.OBJ=OBL arise-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`Who will get it [= the school] up again?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentences \REF{ex:syntax:12} and \REF{ex:syntax:13} provide examples of the morpheme ___ ‘who? [\textsc{sg}]’ (further discussed in \sectref{sec:6.5}). This form is often shortened to [ko]. Whereas the form the morpheme ___ ‘who? [\textsc{sg}]’ refers to exactly its gloss ___ referent, the form kuma ‘who? [\textsc{nsg]}’ refers to two or more referents.\footnote{Thus the number distinction made in the words meaning ‘who?’ (or ‘whose?’) is a binary distinction of \isi{singular} versus \isi{non-singular}, as opposed to the three-way contrast of \isi{singular}, \isi{dual}, and \isi{plural} that runs throughout many other paradigms in the language.}

Sentence (with missing item): u ma=n ___ lï-p si-na
Gloss (with missing item): 2SG 3SG.OBJ=OBL ___ put-PFV push-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`Whom will you blame?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As mentiits gloss ___d in \sectref{sec:11.1}, there is no so-called wh-movement in Ulwa; all content questions are asked \isi{in-situ} -- that is, with the questiits gloss ___d element occurring in the same place where it would occur in an equivalent \isi{declarative} sentence. Thus, kwa {\textasciitilde} kuma ‘who?’ or angos ‘what?’ occur in the subject position when the questiits gloss ___d element is the subject of a clause, and they occur in the object position when the questiits gloss ___d element is an object. Likewise, kwanji {\textasciitilde} kumanji ‘whose?’ occurs immediately before the \isi{possessed} NP, just as would any \is{possessive pronoun} possessive pronominal marker. Thus, for example, in \REF{ex:syntax:14}, the ‘who(m)?’ element occurs in the position typically held by objects.
A: word: ko	 gloss: one

Sentence (with missing item): wambana ___ inim ma=u ma-n
Gloss (with missing item): fish ___ water 3SG.OBJ=from go-IPFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`How many fish are swimming?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In questions of countable quantity, the \isi{question word} the morpheme ___ ‘how many?’ appears after the \isi{noun phrase} whose quantity is the topic of questioning. This could be either a subject or an object (or even an \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}). The word the morpheme ___ ‘how many?’ is thus syntactically identical to any modifying \isi{adjective} and -- in particular -- to \isi{numeral}s, which immediately follow the enumerated NP. Its use is exemplified in \REF{ex:syntax:15} and \REF{ex:syntax:16}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`How many fish did you catch?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In questions of countable quantity, the \isi{question word} the morpheme ___ ‘how many?’ appears after the \isi{noun phrase} whose quantity is the topic of questioning. This could be either a subject or an object (or even an \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}).

Sentence (with missing item): u inim ___ ama-p
Gloss (with missing item): 2SG water ___ eat-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`How much water did you drink?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It should be noted that questions of non-countable quantity -- that is, questions about \isi{mass noun}s (i.e., ‘how much?’) -- are not asked with anjika ‘how many?’. Rather, such \isi{interrogative}s can only be formed as ‘yes/no’ questions, in which an inquiry is made whether the amount in question is ‘its gloss ___’ or ‘little’, as seen in examples \REF{ex:syntax:17}, \REF{ex:syntax:18}, and \REF{ex:syntax:19}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`As for me, I’m not one to go around in other people’s jungles.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is interesting to note that there are also examples of clauses with \isi{nominalized verb phrase}s in which ango ‘\textsc{neg}’ is used without any \isi{clause-final negator}. The distinction between the presence and absence of such \isi{clause-final negator} could reflect a possible difference in \isi{scope} for the \isi{negator} ango ‘\textsc{neg’}: the presence of the \isi{clause-final negator} the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{neg’} (or kom ‘\textsc{neg’}) would thus suggest that the non-verbal \isi{predicate} (resulting from a \is{deverbalization} deverbalized verb) is being negated; and the absence of the \isi{clause-final negator} would suggest that the verb itself has been negated (before being \isi{deverbalized}). For example, \REF{ex:syntax:148} contains the morpheme ___ \textsc{‘neg’}, whereas \REF{ex:syntax:149} lacks it.

You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ mï mïnjika=n ngunan=kï-p
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3SG.SUBJ speech=OBL 1DU.INCL=say-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`No, he said the following to us: …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is relatively uncommon to answer ‘yes’ or ‘its gloss ___’ to \isi{question}s in Ulwa: rather, interlocutors tend to respond with full answers or \isi{paralinguistic gesture}s (such as head movements) or \isi{interjection}s (such as m ‘hm!’). It is nevertheless possible to use the word ase ‘its gloss ___’ (sometimes realized as [the morpheme ___]), whether as a \isi{response} to a \isi{question}, or as a simple denial (without any \isi{question} necessarily having been posed). Sentences \REF{ex:syntax:176} through \REF{ex:syntax:179} provide examples of its use.
A: word: asa	 gloss: no
B: word: ambla=asa-p	 gloss: PL.REFL=hit-PFV

Sentence (with missing item): awal imba p-e unan ___
Gloss (with missing item): yesterday night be{-dep} 1PL.INCL ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Last night we talked.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In examples \REF{ex:syntax:180}, \REF{ex:syntax:181}, and \REF{ex:syntax:182}, the verb of speaking ta- ‘say’ or kï- ‘say’ is used \isi{intransitive}ly. The form [na], when present, is glossed as the \isi{detransitivizing} marker (\sectref{sec:13.8.2}), although the argument could be made that it is the noun na ‘talk’ functioning as the first half of a \isi{compound verb} form. Since the verb of speaking is often \isi{transitive}, however, the analysis of [na] here as the \isi{detransitivizing} marker na- \textsc{‘detr’} is preferred, since the form seems to be helping to \is{valency reduction} reduce the \isi{valency} of the verb.
A: word: na-ta-p	 gloss: DETR-say-PFV

The English translation of this sentence is:`I saw the two of them and said: …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As illustrated by examples such as \REF{ex:syntax:191}, among others, it is common for verbs of speaking (or at least the verb ta- ‘say’) to be \isi{defective} -- that is, the \isi{verb stem} is often left unmarked for \isi{TAM} (and loses its \isi{stem}-final \isi{vowel}), thus being pronounced as just [t]. This occurs especially in situations in which the object of \isi{speech} is an \isi{expletive} (or \isi{dummy}) object.
A: word: ma=ta	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=say

Sentence (with missing item): nï ___ ma=kï-na ase
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ 3SG.OBJ=say-IRR no
The English translation of this sentence is:`I will tell him “no”.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the \isi{oblique marker} is absent, on the other hand, then the construction is athe morpheme ___lyzed as a \is{compound verb} \isi{compound} \isi{verb phrase} in which the nomithe morpheme ___l element occurs before the object (that is, they are \isi{separable verb} constructions; see \sectref{sec:9.2.1}).\footnote{In certain situations, however, it is impossible to tell whether the form [the morpheme ___] contains the \isi{enclitic} =n ‘\textsc{obl}’ or not: if [the morpheme ___] is followed by a word that begins with /n-/ or /nd-/, then the sequence /nn/ -- if ever present -- would \isi{degemithe morpheme ___te} to [n].} In examples \REF{ex:syntax:201} through \REF{ex:syntax:206}, the verbs ta- ‘say’ and kï- ‘say’ are used \isi{transitive}ly, taking as an object the person addressed. Although the word the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is present, it does not take the \isi{oblique marker} =n `\textsc{obl}’. Accordingly, these sentences are interpreted as containing \isi{compound} \isi{verb phrase}s, in which the nomithe morpheme ___l component is separate from the \isi{verb stem}, occurring before the object.
A: word: na	 gloss: talk

The English translation of this sentence is:`Alma said that Guren built the house.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When \isi{speech} is reported indirectly, two clauses are employed: a \isi{matrix clause} containing the verb of speaking and a \isi{dependent clause} containing the \isi{reported speech}. The \isi{dependent clause}, which consists of the indirect \isi{speech}, is embedded within the \isi{matrix clause}. Embedded \isi{dependent clause}s of \isi{indirect discourse} maintain Ulwa’s canonical S(O)V \isi{word order}. As in any clause, the subject of the \isi{embedded clause} may be omitted; this may be especially common when the subject of the \isi{embedded clause} matches that of the \isi{matrix clause} (e.g., ‘he\textsubscript{i} said that he\textsubscript{i} …’). In \REF{ex:syntax:232}, the form [na] (which is not necessarily required in such constructions) is analyzed as the \isi{detransitivizing} marker na- ‘\textsc{detr}’.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[He] thought that [the crocodile] might go around with him to kill him.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A \isi{reflexive} \isi{pronoun} may be used within the \isi{embedded clause} of \isi{speech} to refer to the speaker, which is the subject of the \isi{matrix clause}.\footnote{See examples \REF{ex:pron:23}, \REF{ex:pron:24}, and \REF{ex:pron:25} in \sectref{sec:6.3} for illustrations of how \isi{binding} principles apply within \isi{indirect discourse}.} This only seems to occur when the \isi{pronoun} referring to the speaker in the \isi{embedded clause} has a role other than subject; otherwise, no \isi{pronoun} is used at all.

Gloss (with missing item): water ___ 1SG go-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`If it rains, I’ll go.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A basic \isi{conditional} statement in Ulwa consists of two clauses, the first (the \isi{protasis}) expressing the condition, and the second (the \isi{apodosis}) expressing the consequence. There are variations to this pattern, though, such as sentences that include more than one \isi{protasis}, sentences that include more than one \isi{apodosis}, and sentences in which the result clause is not a statement, but rather a \isi{question} or a \isi{command}. An example of a simple \isi{conditional} sentence is given in \REF{ex:syntax:240}.
A: word: lopo-ta	 gloss: rain-COND
B: word: lopo-p	 gloss: wash-PFV

The English translation of this sentence is:`If you just eat the food there, the owners will go hungry.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Notably, there is no \isi{conditional} marking on the first verb in the \isi{protasis}, even though it is not \isi{defective} here. There are, however, instances in which multiple verbs in the \isi{protasis} may be marked with the \isi{conditional} \isi{suffix} -ta ‘\textsc{cond}’. In such sentences, it can be assumed that each verb represents a condition that must be met for the state or event in the \isi{apodosis} to be or occur. Often these are best translated in \ili{English} with a single clause, often with a single verb. The Ulwa sentence, however, contains multiple verbs in the \isi{protasis} that may constitute either a single clause with multiple \isi{verb phrase}s or a multiclausal \isi{protasis}, as in \REF{ex:syntax:253}.\footnote{This sentence has two verbs marked with the \isi{conditional} \isi{suffix} -ta ‘\textsc{cond}’ in the \isi{protasis} (literally ‘if you are just here and if [you] eat food …’). Note that a simple \isi{irrealis} \isi{stem} of ama- ‘eat’ (i.e., [la-]) is employed, and not an \isi{irrealis perfective} \isi{compound} \isi{stem} (i.e., not \textsuperscript{†}/la-ama-/).

Note that a simple \isi{irrealis} \isi{stem} of ama- ‘eat’ (i.e., [la-]) is employed, and not an \isi{irrealis perfective} \isi{compound} \isi{stem} (i.e., not \textsuperscript{†}/la-ama-/). This is because the \isi{hypothetical} event in the \isi{protasis} is not \isi{perfective} – that is, the event need not have been completed for the situation in the \isi{apodosis} to be true.}

Question 320:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ nï ma=andïm sa-ta mï nï=tï awi lï-p nï=ul wandam ma-na
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1SG 3SG.OBJ=for cry{-cond} 3SG.SUBJ 1SG=take shoulder put-PFV 1SG=with jungle go-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`When [I] was a child and I would cry for him [= my father], he would put me on his shoulder and go with me to the jungle.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Note, however, that verbs in the \isi{protasis} clause or clauses should properly be marked as \isi{conditional} only if the \isi{apodosis} is in fact contingent on them. Thus, in sentence \REF{ex:syntax:254}, the first verb (in fact a \isi{verbalized} noun) receives no \isi{conditional} \isi{suffix}, but rather is \isi{dependent-marked}.
A: word: nungolke=p-e	 gloss: child=COP{-dep}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is possible for the \isi{question} word to occur in the \isi{protasis} even when (at least in the \ili{English} translation) the \isi{interrogative} would be expected to occur in the \isi{apodosis}, as is the case in \REF{ex:syntax:261}. This may have something to do with the placement and \isi{scope} of the \isi{negator} the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{neg}’ in \isi{multiclausal construction}s (\sectref{sec:13.3.3}), since the \isi{question word}s are etymologically related to the morpheme ___ ‘\textsc{neg}’.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is also common for \is{apodosis} apodoses to take the form of \isi{imperative}s. In fact, \isi{conditional} constructions often serve the \isi{pragmatic} function of softening a \isi{request} or \isi{command} (\sectref{sec:13.2}), as seen in \REF{ex:syntax:262}.

Question 359:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): inom utam ___
Gloss (with missing item): mother yam ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Mother cooked the yams.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Likewise, in the \isi{active-voice} sentence in \REF{ex:syntax:274}, the \isi{word order} is SOV, whereas in the passive-\isi{voice} sentence in \REF{ex:syntax:275}, the \isi{word order} is VS. The subject argument in the \isi{passive} sentence corresponds to the object argument of its \is{active voice} active equivalent.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The yams were cooked.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Likewise, in the \isi{active-voice} sentence in \REF{ex:syntax:274}, the \isi{word order} is SOV, whereas in the passive-\isi{voice} sentence in \REF{ex:syntax:275}, the \isi{word order} is VS.

Question 361:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ lamndu mï
Gloss (with missing item): ___ pig 3SG.SUBJ
The English translation of this sentence is:`The pig was killed.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As the grammatical subject in the \isi{passive} sentence, the postverbal \isi{patient}-like argument is the only obligatory argument of the verb. As the subject, it is marked not with the \isi{object marker} but with the \isi{subject marker}.\footnote{Although these markers are usually \isi{homophonous}, there is a distinction in the 3\textsc{sg} form: mï ‘3\textsc{sg.subj’} for subjects and ma= ‘3\textsc{sg.obj’} for \isi{non-subject}s (\sectref{sec:7.2}, \sectref{sec:11.2}). Crucially, as in example \REF{ex:syntax:273}, the form [mï] (and not \textsuperscript{†}[ma]) follows the subject of the \isi{passive} clause.} Furthermore, the verb in the \isi{passive} sentence does not permit an \isi{object-marker} \isi{proclitic}, since the \isi{semantic} \isi{patient} (the object of the equivalent \is{active voice} active sentence) has been promoted to the role of subject. The difference in \isi{word order} between \isi{active-voice} and \isi{passive-voice} clauses is presented in \REF{ex:syntax:275a}.
A: word: asa-p-e	 gloss: hit-PFV-DEP
B: word: ko=asa-p-e	 gloss: INDF=hit-PFV-DEP
C: word: asa-p	 gloss: hit-PFV
D: word: lï-ta	 gloss: put-COND

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Perhaps examples such as \REF{ex:syntax:273} and \REF{ex:syntax:275} could be analyzed as \isi{relative clause}s. For example, sentence \REF{ex:syntax:275} could actually mean something like ‘the yams that were cooked’. However, since these examples are all fully capable of serving as \isi{independent} sentences, not \isi{dependent} on any other clause, they are analyzed here as indeed \isi{passive} sentences and not as \isi{relative clause}s.
A: word: asa-p-e	 gloss: hit-PFV-DEP

Sentence (with missing item): umbe ___ lamndu
Gloss (with missing item): tomorrow ___ pig
The English translation of this sentence is:`The pig will be killed tomorrow.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{suffix} \textit{{}-e} ‘\textsc{dep}’ does not appear, at least not overtly, in \isi{irrealis}-\isi{mood} passives. Since the \isi{irrealis} \isi{suffix} invariably ends in [-a], and a \isi{phonological} rule would syncopate a following /e/, it is, however, possible that there is an underlying \isi{suffix} /-e/ even in these \isi{irrealis}-\isi{mood} passives. Sentence \REF{ex:syntax:278} provides an example of an \isi{irrealis}-\isi{mood} \isi{passive} sentence.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the \isi{agent} of a \isi{passive} sentence need not be expressed, it can be included as an \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}. In \is{active voice} active sentences, \isi{oblique}s (such as \isi{temporal adverb}s) occur either in clause-initial position or immediately before the \isi{verb phrase} -- that is, before the verb in \isi{intransitive} clauses, and before the object of the verb in \isi{transitive} clauses. Likewise, the \isi{agent} \isi{oblique} \isi{phrase}, if included, appears at the beginning of the \isi{passive} clause, immediately before the verb. The \isi{oblique marker} =n ‘\textsc{obl}’ (\sectref{sec:11.4.1}) is used to identify the \isi{agent} of \isi{passive} verbs, as in sentences \REF{ex:syntax:282}, \REF{ex:syntax:283}, and \REF{ex:syntax:284}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are, for example, several ways of encoding ‘breaking’ events in Ulwa, but none of them instantiates \isi{P-lability}. The verbs a- ‘break’, kol- ‘break, split’, kot- ‘break, bear’, and kun- ‘break, break off’ are all \isi{transitive}, with the P argument referring to that which is broken; the verbs nungun u- ‘break (\isi{intransitive})’ and tukul- ‘break (\isi{intransitive})’, on the other hand, are both \isi{intransitive}, with the S argument referring to that which is broken. Sentence \REF{ex:syntax:296} exemplifies the use of the \isi{intransitive} verb tukul- ‘break’.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[We] went there and broke a sago palm.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although tukul- ‘break’ may be etymologically related to kol- ‘break’, kot- ‘break’, or kun- ‘break’, it is not synchronically derived by any process (i.e., there is no known \isi{prefix} \textsuperscript{†}/tu-/). At any rate, the \isi{transitive} verb a- ‘break’ is not related to any of these forms, whether diachronically or synchronically.

Gloss (with missing item): 3PL ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`They built [something].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is an important \isi{bound morpheme} in Ulwa that serves a number of grammatical functions, often with nuances that are difficult to explain, but whose basic function seems to be to reduce the \isi{transitivity} of verbs \citep{Barlow2019b}. This is the verbal \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr’} (i.e., “\isi{detransitivizer}”). Reasons for treating the detransitivizing form na- \textsc{‘detr’} as a \isi{prefix} rather than a \isi{clitic} include the fact that it only occurs before verbs and the fact that \isi{object-marker} \isi{proclitic}s may precede it. It may be seen in sentence \REF{ex:syntax:297c}.

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ndï=ul ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL=with ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[Let’s] eat with them!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr’} can occur with other verbs, also marking them as \isi{intransitive}. In example \REF{ex:syntax:306}, the verb ama- {\textasciitilde} la- ‘eat’ is \isi{transitive} (i.e., it has an overt object). This sentence may be compared with examples \REF{ex:syntax:307} and \REF{ex:syntax:308}, in which the same verb is \isi{intransitive}, in these examples being marked with the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’}.
A: word: na-la-nda	 gloss: DETR-eat-IRR
B: word: ndï=na-na-la-nda	 gloss: 3PL=DETR-DETR-eat-IRR

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): unan angos ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL.INCL what ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`What shall we eat?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The morpheme na- \textsc{‘detr’} is often better described as reducing the \isi{transitivity} of a verb rather than changing its \isi{valency}. In example \REF{ex:syntax:309}, the object of the verb is technically the \isi{question word} angos ‘what?’. However, given the fact that the event that the verb is encoding is far from being prototypically \isi{transitive} (i.e., the situation is non-punctual, \isi{irrealis}, etc.), it is not surprising that the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} is employed.
A: word: na-la-nda	 gloss: DETR-eat-IRR
B: word: ndï=na-na-la-nda	 gloss: 3PL=DETR-DETR-eat-IRR
C: word: imwa	 gloss: [place]

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{ex:syntax:310} and \REF{ex:syntax:311} illustrate how the verb ita- ‘build’ can likewise be detransitivized with the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’}. In example \REF{ex:syntax:310}, the verb is \isi{transitive} and receives the \isi{object marker} ma= ‘3\textsc{sg.obj}’; in example \REF{ex:syntax:311}, the verb is \isi{intransitive}, and receives the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’}.

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.OBJ=be{-dep} ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`While [he] was there, [they] were gathering.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: One function of the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} seems to be to create something like a \isi{middle voice} construction, indicating that the \isi{agent} of the verb is also affected by the verb, without being its grammatical object.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They used to do work like this.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sometimes the role of the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} is not entirely clear. It occurs at times, for example, with the verb ni- ‘act, do’. It is not, however, always present; and it is difficult to explain its presence as a form of \isi{detransitivization}, as the verb ni- ‘act’ is not particularly \isi{transitive}. When it does select an argument (i.e., when the verb has the sense of ‘do [something]’), this argument is marked with the \isi{oblique marker} =n \textsc{‘obl’}, as in \REF{ex:syntax:318}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It could be argued that example \REF{ex:syntax:318} is actually \isi{transitive}, with the \isi{object marker} ma= \textsc{‘3sg.obj’} attaching directly to the \isi{verb stem}. Indeed, the surface form is [wo.mbïn.ma.ne], which does not offer any \isi{phonological} evidence of the \isi{oblique marker} /=n/, which -- I argue -- has \isi{deleted} before the immediately following /n/. However, its existence as an underlying form is supported by examples in which the \isi{allomorph} /=nï/ appears as the \isi{oblique marker} \REF{ex:syntax:319}.

Sentence (with missing item): mï wandam ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SUBJ jungle ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`It’s become a jungle.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sometimes when the morpheme na- \textsc{‘detr’} affixes to the \isi{locative verb} p- ‘be at’, the verb seems to have a meaning closer to that of the generic \isi{copula} =p ‘\textsc{cop}’, which likely derived from it (\sectref{sec:10.3}). When used along with /p/, the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} often gives the sense of ‘become’ rather than ‘be’, although this is not always the case. Although \isi{semantic}ally more similar to the \isi{copula}, the form [p] here is functionally more similar to the verb in that it allows a verbal \isi{prefix} (na- ‘\textsc{detr’}). This sort of ambiguity that exists between the \isi{locative verb} p- ‘be’ and the \isi{copular enclitic} =p ‘\textsc{cop}’ may be due to undergoing a process of \isi{grammaticalization}. Sentences \REF{ex:syntax:325} through \REF{ex:syntax:328} all convey the sense of ‘becoming’.

Gloss (with missing item): 3SG.SUBJ 3SG.OBJ=with out-here-go.PFV water DETR-go.PFV-DEP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`It went with it out into the water and stayed around there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Rather more challenging to explain, the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ may be used in conjunction with \isi{object-marking} \isi{proclitic}s. When present, the \isi{object marker} always precedes the \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’. Interestingly, when the 3\textsc{sg} marker is used, it takes the subject form [mï=] and not the object form \textsuperscript{†}[ma=]. In other words, although functioning to indicate the object of the verb, the marker in such constructions has the formal appearance of a \isi{subject marker}. The fact that the morpheme na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ immediately precedes \isi{verb stem}s and follows \isi{object-marker} \isi{proclitic}s is support for the claim that it is a verbal \isi{prefix}. Sentences \REF{ex:syntax:329} through \REF{ex:syntax:332} exemplify the use of \isi{object marker}s along with the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- `\textsc{detr}’.

Question 440:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ ambi mï=na-ita-na
Gloss (with missing item): ___ big 3SG.SUBJ=DETR-build-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`[I] will build a big house.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It may be that these forms have some level of reduced \isi{transitivity} or that the object of the \isi{transitive} verb is less definite. Sometimes, however, the \isi{direct object} of the verb marked with both the \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ and an \isi{object marker} is expressed as a full NP, as in examples \REF{ex:syntax:333}, \REF{ex:syntax:334}, and \REF{ex:syntax:335}. It is difficult to see the morpheme na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ as a means of reducing either \isi{transitivity} or \isi{definiteness} in examples such as these. That said, example \REF{ex:syntax:335} does seem best translated with an \isi{indefinite} article.

Gloss (with missing item): DETR-go.PFV go.PFV DETR-go.PFV [place] ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] went and went, went to Imwa.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In some instances, it seems that the simultaneous use of the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ and an \isi{object marker} may be attributable to frequent use of the \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ with certain verbs. For example, verb forms such as [nay] (< na- ‘\textsc{detr’} + i ‘go.\textsc{pfv’}) are so common, that it could be that, for some speakers, the \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’ has \isi{fossilized} to the verb root, having lost its original detransitivizing meaning, as for example in \REF{ex:syntax:336}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I went with her and came home here.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The hypothesis that [nay] has \isi{fossilized} as a monomorphemic form may be supported by the fact that it itself may receive the \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’}, in effect giving the \isi{verb stem} two detransitivizing \isi{prefix}es, as in \REF{ex:syntax:337}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`As for me, I’ve had enough.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{stem} kamb- ‘shun’ also frequently seems to have a \isi{fossilized} \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’}, especially when the verb has the sense ‘suffice, have enough’, as in \REF{ex:syntax:338}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Mawna told Yawat to leave [and he did].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In Ulwa, \isi{command}s expressed in \isi{reported speech} reveal a distinction between \isi{realis} and \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}s.

Namely, it is not clear whether John actually left or not. In Ulwa, however, the \isi{TAM} of the verb (e.g., leave in the \linebreak \ili{English} example) reveals whether the \isi{imperative} led to the desired outcome (\isi{realis}) or not (\isi{irrealis}). This may be seen with a contrasting pair of sentences, one with \isi{perfective} \isi{aspect} (i.e., \isi{realis} \isi{mood}) \REF{ex:syntax:356} and another with \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} \REF{ex:syntax:357}.

Question 480:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Mawna mï ___ Yawat ma=ta-e mï ma-na
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___ [name] 3SG.OBJ=say-DEP 3SG.SUBJ go-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`Mawna told Yawat to leave [but it is unclear whether or not he did].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In Ulwa, \isi{command}s expressed in \isi{reported speech} reveal a distinction between \isi{realis} and \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}s. In \ili{English}, for example, there is a degree of ambiguity created by sentences that employ \isi{non-finite verb form}s (i.e., \isi{infinitive}s), such as the following: Mary told John \textbf{to leave}. Namely, it is not clear whether John actually left or not. In Ulwa, however, the \isi{TAM} of the verb (e.g., leave in the \linebreak \ili{English} example) reveals whether the \isi{imperative} led to the desired outcome (\isi{realis}) or not (\isi{irrealis}). This may be seen with a contrasting pair of sentences, one with \isi{perfective} \isi{aspect} (i.e., \isi{realis} \isi{mood}) \REF{ex:syntax:356} and another with \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} \REF{ex:syntax:357}.

Sentence (with missing item): sokoy ulwa=p-e nï [nï-nji wa ma-na] ___
Gloss (with missing item): tobacco nothing=COP-DEP 1SG [1SG-POSS village go-IRR] ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Since there’s no tobacco, I want to go to my village.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The expression of wants follows patterns very similar to those of \isi{indirect discourse} (\sectref{sec:13.4.5}). Indeed, the most common way of expressing that one wants something to happen is to use a verb of speaking or thinking, typically kï- ‘say’ and typically expressed in the \isi{perfective} \isi{mood} and with the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} (thus: [nakap], literally ‘said’ or ‘thought’). This form has likely been somewhat \isi{fossilized} as a word used to express desires. The clause expressing the desire is a \isi{dependent clause} embedded within a \isi{matrix clause} that has as its subject the person who desires something. The verb in the \isi{dependent clause} is always marked as \isi{irrealis}, as in sentences \REF{ex:syntax:379} through \REF{ex:syntax:382}. Brackets enclose the \isi{embedded clause}s.

Sentence (with missing item): {[na} anda=n {nï-kï-na]} ___
Gloss (with missing item): {[talk} SG.DIST=OBL 1SG=say-IRR] ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Do [you] want to tell me something?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The expression of wants follows patterns very similar to those of \isi{indirect discourse} (\sectref{sec:13.4.5}). Indeed, the most common way of expressing that one wants something to happen is to use a verb of speaking or thinking, typically kï- ‘say’ and typically expressed in the \isi{perfective} \isi{mood} and with the detransitivizing \isi{prefix} na- \textsc{‘detr’} (thus: [nakap], literally ‘said’ or ‘thought’). This form has likely been somewhat \isi{fossilized} as a word used to express desires. The clause expressing the desire is a \isi{dependent clause} embedded within a \isi{matrix clause} that has as its subject the person who desires something. The verb in the \isi{dependent clause} is always marked as \isi{irrealis}, as in sentences \REF{ex:syntax:379} through \REF{ex:syntax:382}. Brackets enclose the \isi{embedded clause}s.

Sentence (with missing item): {[nï} {ma-na]} ___ nï mïnja=n ma=ta
Gloss (with missing item): {[1SG} go-IRR] ___ 1SG speech=OBL 3SG.OBJ=say
The English translation of this sentence is:`[Wala] wanted me to go, but I told him: …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The subject of the \isi{matrix clause} (the person desiring something) need not be the subject of the \isi{embedded clause} (the \isi{agent} desired to do something). In sentence \REF{ex:syntax:383}, the subject of the \isi{matrix clause} is an understood third party, whereas the subject of the \isi{embedded clause} is the speaker (1\textsc{sg)}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[Wala] wanted me to go, but I told him: …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The form [nakap], as seen in \REF{ex:syntax:383}, can be used regardless of \isi{TAM} distinctions: thus, for example, many sentences with this form have \isi{imperfective} force, despite the typically perfective-marking \isi{suffix} -p \textsc{‘pfv’}. Moreover, the form [nakap] may be used without any \isi{conditional} marking, even in the \isi{protasis} of a \isi{conditional sentence}, as in \REF{ex:syntax:384}.
A: word: na-kï-p	 gloss: DETR-say-PFV
B: word: an=wana-kï-p	 gloss: 1PL.EXCL=feel-say-PFV

Gloss (with missing item): {[leg} throw-COND put-IRR] ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`If you want to throw your legs around …’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In example \REF{ex:syntax:385}, the \isi{conditional} marker -ta \textsc{‘cond’} occurs within the \isi{embedded clause}, instead of being affixed to the \isi{matrix clause} verb form [nakap] (cf. issues of \isi{scope} in \sectref{sec:13.3.4}).
A: word: na-kï-p	 gloss: DETR-say-PFV

Sentence (with missing item): {[nï=ul} {ma-na]} ___
Gloss (with missing item): {[1SG=with} go-IRR] ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[He] wanted to go with me.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{semantic} connection between verbs of speaking or thinking and verbs of desiring is understandable. Often, when one wants something, one talks about it (and almost certainly thinks about it). While [nakap] seems to be a \isi{fossilized} form used in \isi{desiderative} clauses, it is nevertheless possible to use other verbs of speaking to express desires, as in the \isi{desiderative} sentence given in \REF{ex:syntax:386}, which uses the verb ta- ‘say’.
A: word: na-ta-e	 gloss: DETR-say-DEP
B: word: u=na-ta-e	 gloss: 2SG=talk-say-DEP

Sentence (with missing item): nï lamndu ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG pig ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`I want to kill a pig.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to these \is{biclausal construction} biclausal \isi{desiderative} constructions, it is possible to express a desire in a single clause, simply by using an \isi{irrealis} verb form. In such instances, it is not necessarily clear whether the person desiring the event encoded by the verb is the subject of the verb, the speaker of the clause, or both. In examples \REF{ex:syntax:387} through \REF{ex:syntax:391}, all translated with ‘want’, the \isi{irrealis} verb forms could, in other contexts, impart other meanings (e.g., ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘can’, etc.; see \sectref{sec:4.6}).
A: word: ma=wali-nda	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=hit-IRR
B: word: ambla=wali-nda	 gloss: PL.REFL=hit-IRR

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{ex:syntax:391} illustrates a \isi{negative desire}. Often, to express that something is not desired, the verb kamb- ‘shun’ (\sectref{sec:2.1.2}) is used. It may take either the \isi{imperfective} (or unmarked) form kam ‘shun [\textsc{ipfv}]’, the \isi{imperfective} form kambe ‘shun [\textsc{ipfv]’}, or the \isi{perfective} form kamp ‘shun [\textsc{pfv]’}, as shown in \REF{ex:syntax:392}.

Sentence (with missing item): nï mana ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG spear ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`I want a spear.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: To express that an object is desired, Ulwa simply employs the verb tï- ‘take’ in the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}. After all, to say, for example, that one ‘wants a spear’ means that one ‘wants to take (i.e., obtain, have) a spear’. In other words, a proclamation such as ‘I would take’ links, by inference, to ‘I want’. This is illustrated in \REF{ex:syntax:393} and \REF{ex:syntax:394}.
A: word: tï-na	 gloss: take-IRR
