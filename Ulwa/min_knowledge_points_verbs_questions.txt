Sentence (with missing item): ankam wa ___
Gloss (with missing item): person just ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`People will just die.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In all such instances of irregularity or \isi{suppletion} in \isi{verb stem}s, the alternations are conditioned by \isi{TAM} distinctions. There are no verbs whose \isi{stem}s alter according to the \isi{person} of an argument, whether subject or object. There may be one verb, however, that exhibits an alternation based on the \isi{number} of the subject argument. The \isi{verb stem} ni- ‘die’ appears to have a weakly \isi{suppletive} \isi{stem} nipinpu- ‘die.\textsc{pl}’ that is used when the subject is \isi{plural} (or the event is \isi{iterative}), thus representing perhaps a solitary example of \isi{pluractionality}. This \isi{pluractional} verb form appears to be a \isi{compound} containing u- ‘put’ (see \sectref{sec:9.2.2}). Examples are given in \REF{ex:verbs:10} through \REF{ex:verbs:13}.

Sentence (with missing item): ndï ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`They died one by one.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is some variability in the pronunciation of the second \isi{vowel} of \textit{nipinpu{}-} ‘die.\textsc{pl}’, often being pronounced [u] (i.e., [nipunpu]) perhaps under influence from the following /u/. It may be possible for ni- ‘die’ to be used optionally with \isi{plural} subjects or events, but this seems rarely to be the case (the only examples of \isi{plural} ni- ‘die’ come from elicitations). On the other hand, the use of nipinpu ‘die.\textsc{pl}’ with a \isi{singular} subject will produce a \isi{semantic}ally unlikely interpretation, as illustrated by the elicited examples \REF{ex:verbs:14}, \REF{ex:verbs:15}, and \REF{ex:verbs:16}.

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Gambri mï (tap) apa ___
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ (maybe) house ___
The English translation of this sentence is:(a) ‘Gambri should build the house.’\\’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{irrealis} \isi{suffix} can express a number of \isi{modal} distinctions, such as \isi{deontic} (‘should’, ‘must’), \isi{abilitative} (‘can’, ‘could’), and \isi{optative} (‘would that’) moods, as illustrated by \REF{ex:verbs:35}.
A: word: ma=ita-na	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=build-IRR
B: word: anda=ita-na	 gloss: SG.DIST=build-IRR

Question 21:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens.

Sentence (with missing item): Gambri mï (tap) apa ___
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ (maybe) house ___
The English translation of this sentence is:(a) ‘Gambri should build the house.’\\’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{epistemic adverb} tap ‘maybe’ is often possible in these sentences, but it is not necessary for conveying \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} (\sectref{sec:8.2.4}). Note, however, that tap ‘maybe’ cannot be used when the speaker wishes to convey that the action will necessarily happen (i.e., ‘will’, ‘must’). Thus, sentence \REF{ex:verbs:35} (with tap ‘maybe’ included), cannot mean *‘Gambri will build the house’ or *‘Gambri must build the house’.
A: word: ma=ita-na	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ=build-IRR
B: word: anda=ita-na	 gloss: SG.DIST=build-IRR

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When used in reference to \isi{past} \isi{time}, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} indicates \isi{potential} (i.e., ability) or lack thereof \REF{ex:verbs:36}.
A: word: ma-na	 gloss: go-IRR

The English translation of this sentence is:`[He] would have gone down with [his] children yesterday.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When used in reference to \isi{past} \isi{time}, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} can also indicate a \isi{counterfactual} statement, as in \REF{ex:verbs:37}.
A: word: ma-na	 gloss: go-IRR
B: word: ma-na-ta	 gloss: go-IRR-COND

Gloss (with missing item): yesterday thus child 3PL=with down ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[He] would have gone down with [his] children yesterday.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentence \REF{ex:verbs:37} is proven to be \isi{counterfactual} by the speaker’s immediately following sentence \REF{ex:verbs:38}, which shows that this intended action of the man going with his children was unrealized.

Sentence (with missing item): wa ma=i ndï=ul ___
Gloss (with missing item): village 3SG.OBJ=go.PFV 3PL=with ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] went home to eat with them.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentences such as \REF{ex:verbs:39} and \REF{ex:verbs:40} are analyzed as consisting of two full clauses, so there is actually nothing akin \isi{syntactic}ally to the \ili{English} \isi{infinitive}. The absence of \is{dependent marker} dependent marking (\sectref{sec:12.2.1}) on the first clauses of examples \REF{ex:verbs:39} and \REF{ex:verbs:40} suggests that the clauses containing these \isi{purpose}-denoting \isi{irrealis} verbs are actually \isi{independent} sentences, without any sentences \isi{dependent} upon them. Thus, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{suffix} can be considered here a means of imbuing a \isi{desiderative} or \isi{intentive} meaning to the verb. Thus, \REF{ex:verbs:39} could be translated ‘[They] went home; [they] wanted to eat with them’; and \REF{ex:verbs:40} could be translated ‘[We] beat it; [we] intended to give it to [our] uncle’.
A: word: la-nda	 gloss: eat-IRR

The English translation of this sentence is:`[She] had told me.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{semantic} effect of this \isi{double perfective} is often one of signaling that an action is all-the-more over-and-done-with. Since a single \isi{perfective} marker typically signals that the event is viewed as whole and completed, this double marking could be seen as superfluous.\footnote{Indeed, it may be that -- as speakers use different \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}es ever more interchangeably, perhaps as the result of \isi{grammatical attrition} -- the extra \isi{perfective} marking is simply redundant (see \chapref{sec:15} for structural changes due to \isi{grammatical attrition}).} There are instances, however, in which the \isi{double perfective} functions something like the \isi{pluperfect} category of some European languages, showing that an event is not only viewed as a completed whole, but that is has been completed before the \isi{time} of some other event in the more-recent \isi{past}. These usages can often be translated with the \ili{English} \isi{auxiliary} ‘had’ plus the past participle, as in examples \REF{ex:verbs:41} through \REF{ex:verbs:45}.

You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): nï-nji wot yena mï ta ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG-POSS younger woman 3SG.SUBJ already ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`My younger sister has already died.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is also possible for the word ta ‘already’ to appear within a clause exhibiting such a construction \REF{ex:verbs:47}.\footnote{In example \REF{ex:verbs:47}, however, it may be that the form /nip/ has been \isi{reanalyzed} as monomorphemic, a new verb ‘die’, derived from the \isi{perfective} form of the verb ni- ‘die’ (cf. the \isi{pluractional} version of this verb, nipinpu- ‘die.\textsc{pl}’, \sectref{sec:4.3}).}

The English translation of this sentence is:`Those posts have already broken.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentences \REF{ex:verbs:46} and \REF{ex:verbs:47} also illustrate the fact that the \isi{vowel}s in the second \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix} do not always match the final \isi{vowel} of the \isi{verb stem}. Indeed, there is variability within certain verb forms. For example, there are attested forms such as lï-p-ap ‘put-\textsc{pfv-pfv}’ alongside lï-p-ïp ‘put-\textsc{pfv-pfv}’, as seen in \REF{ex:verbs:45}. It may be that some of these putative second \isi{perfective} forms are actually reduced forms of the \isi{past} \isi{locative verb} wap ‘be.\textsc{pst}’ (\sectref{sec:10.4}).\footnote{Indeed, it is possible that they have all derived historically from wap ‘be.\textsc{pst}’, which is often pronounced [wɔp]: thus, it may be that first the /w/ was lost; then, when following non-low \isi{vowel}s, the \isi{vowel} [ɔ] was colored to [o], and when following the \isi{low vowel}, it was colored to [a]. There are no attested (double) \isi{perfective} forms with the \isi{vowel}s [e] or [u] (i.e., \textsuperscript{†}[-ep] and \textsuperscript{†}[-up] are not found as \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix}es).} Sentences \REF{ex:verbs:48} and \REF{ex:verbs:49} further exemplify the form [-op], following the \isi{stem}-final \isi{vowel}s /i/ and /u/, respectively.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[She] went downstream, but that deaf one did not stay here.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some apparent examples of \isi{double perfective} marking may reflect \isi{grammatical attrition}: as verbal \isi{suffix}es come to be used in increasingly interchangeable ways, they lose their \isi{aspect}ual force. Perhaps such seemingly redundant \isi{perfective} markers are used to show that the meaning intended is truly \isi{perfective}. For example, although the form i ‘go.\textsc{pfv}’ is intrinsically marked for \isi{perfective} \isi{aspect}, speakers on occasion add what seems to be a \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix} -- that is, as if they were treating this form as unmarked for \isi{aspect} and thus requiring a \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix}. Example \REF{ex:verbs:52} contains the \isi{perfective} form i ‘go.\textsc{pfv}’ with an unnecessary additional \isi{perfective} marker -ap ‘\textsc{pfv}’, realized here as [-yap] due to \isi{glide} insertion (\sectref{sec:2.5.1}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`[Our] ancestors are the ones who had gone [there].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{ex:verbs:54} shows how a \isi{double perfective} construction can function when i ‘go.\textsc{pfv}’ is \isi{reanalyzed} as lacking (intrinsic) \isi{TAM} marking. In this instance, the speaker uses a perfective-marked form of the \isi{past}-\isi{tense} \isi{locative verb} wap ‘be.\textsc{pst}’ as something like an \isi{auxiliary verb}.\footnote{I suspect that this is a recent innovation, one influenced by \isi{grammatical attrition} in the face of competing influences from the dominant language, \ili{Tok Pisin} (see \chapref{sec:15}).}

Sentence (with missing item): nungol ndï ___
Gloss (with missing item): child 3PL ___
The English translation of this sentence is:(a) ‘The children will eat.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: An interesting tug-of-war occurs when one must refer to a completed action in \isi{future} \isi{time} (cf. the \isi{future} perfect in \ili{English}, e.g., we will have eaten). The three designations in Ulwa’s basic three-way \isi{TAM} system are not mutually exclusive: that is, an event could, theoretically, be viewed both as a completed whole (\isi{perfective} \isi{aspect}) and as something not (yet) real (\isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}). Typically in Ulwa, all \isi{irrealis}-\isi{mood} verbs are treated the same -- that is, there are no \isi{aspect}ual distinctions maintained among them (\sectref{sec:4.6}). Thus, the sentence in \REF{ex:verbs:55} could be translated variously into \ili{English}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Once [we] have eaten them, then you will kill pigs!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In a somewhat different but related manner, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{perfective} form of ama- ‘eat’ seems to combine two \isi{stem}s in the same form: the \isi{irrealis} \isi{stem} [la-] and the non-\isi{irrealis} \isi{stem} [ama-] occur together, along with the \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix} \textit{{}-p} ‘\textsc{pfv}’, thus yielding lamap ‘eat [\textsc{irr/pfv]}’. Although elsewhere in examples containing this verb the form [la-] is glossed as the \isi{verb stem} ‘eat’, in \isi{irrealis} \isi{perfective} constructions such as those in \REF{ex:verbs:62} and \REF{ex:verbs:63}, it is glossed as ‘\textsc{irr}’, since it is the part of the verb form that is signaling its \isi{irrealis} value.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Examples \REF{ex:verbs:71} and \REF{ex:verbs:72} both illustrate the sense of ‘might’ being conveyed by the \isi{speculative} \isi{suffix} -t ‘\textsc{spec}’, in both instances directly following an \isi{irrealis} \isi{suffix}. Example \REF{ex:verbs:72} further illustrates this use in \isi{indirect discourse}. This must not, however, be taken to have \is{evidentiality} evidential force -- that is, the \isi{suffix} is used because the \isi{reported speech} is of someone who himself is speculating about whether or not he would come (not because the person reporting this information can only speculate as to whether or not the person would come). Indeed, the speaker who uttered this sentence followed it with the one given in \REF{ex:verbs:73}, which does not include any \isi{speculative} form.\footnote{For more on \isi{indirect discourse}, see \sectref{sec:13.4.5}.}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the \is{protasis} protases of \isi{conditional} statements, the \isi{suffix} -ta ‘\textsc{cond}’ is affixed either to the \isi{stem} of the verb (always including the \isi{vowel}) \REF{ex:verbs:89} or to the \isi{perfective} form (that is, including the \isi{perfective} \isi{suffix}) \REF{ex:verbs:90}.\footnote{Often the two forms appear to be interchangeable. I suspect that, for many speakers, an \isi{aspect}ual or \isi{modal} distinction that perhaps once existed is now being lost. Still, at least in some circumstances, it may be the case that the \isi{perfective} version of the \isi{conditional} verb is required to show a sequence of events.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`If you eat my food, I’ll hit you.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In verbs that exhibit different \isi{stem}s for the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}, the \isi{conditional} form is never built from the \isi{imperfective}/\isi{perfective} \isi{stem} alone. Either it is built from this \isi{realis} \isi{stem} plus the \isi{perfective} marker or it is built from the \isi{suppletive} \isi{irrealis} \isi{stem} without any additional marker (cf. the discussion of \isi{imperative}s in \sectref{sec:4.7}). Thus, the verb ama- ‘eat’ has as its \isi{conditional} form either [amapta] (from the fully \isi{inflect}ed \isi{perfective} form) \REF{ex:verbs:90a} or [lata] (from the \isi{irrealis} \isi{stem}) \REF{ex:verbs:90b}, but never \textsuperscript{†}[amata] (from the \isi{imperfective}/\isi{perfective} \isi{stem} alone).

Gloss (with missing item): 2SG=with jungle go hand take 2SG ear ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] will go to the jungle with you and box your ears with [their] hands.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: While most verbs are composed of simply a single free root (plus, potentially, \is{bound morpheme} bound \isi{morphology} such as \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}es, the \isi{detransitivizing} \isi{prefix} na- ‘\textsc{detr}’, or \isi{object-marker} \isi{proclitic}s), some can be analyzed as \isi{compound}s -- that is, consisting of more than one free morpheme. The final element of such \isi{compound}s (excluding any \isi{suffix}es) is always a \isi{verb stem}. The first element, on the other hand, may be either a noun \REF{ex:verbs:96} or another verb \REF{ex:verbs:97} (or perhaps a \isi{postposition}, although this may be analyzed otherwise).\footnote{Often it is not clear whether such a combination of non-bound morphemes should best be analyzed as a \isi{compound}. A noun preceding a verb, for example, could simply be the object of the verb. Only when this noun-plus-verb combination permits a \isi{direct object} (or an \isi{object marker}) can it be said to be a \isi{compound}. Similarly, two \isi{verb stem}s in succession may be separate words that are \isi{coordinate}d \isi{paratactic}ally. A true \isi{compound} verb consisting of two verbal elements, however, should permit only one \isi{object marker} (that is, the \isi{object marker} should affix to the beginning of the first member of the \isi{compound}). Often, series of \isi{postposition}-plus-verb-stem seem very much like \isi{compound} verbs, especially when considering their \isi{phonological} tendency to coalesce and reduce. However, there are few if any \isi{morphosyntactic} tests to prove that such forms are true compounds.}

Sentence (with missing item): an kaw ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL.EXCL song ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`We danced the song.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Compound verbs may contain nouns as their first element. Evidence that these forms are single (though polymorphemic) \isi{lexical} items comes from the fact that they permit \isi{object marker}s (preceding the entire word) and \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}es (following the entire word). Examples of noun-plus-verb verbal compounds are given in \REF{ex:verbs:98}, \REF{ex:verbs:99}, and \REF{ex:verbs:100}.

Gloss (with missing item): older.sister 3SG.SUBJ just ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`The older sister disapproved of it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some compounds may be composed of just \isi{postposition}s and verbs. While there often seems to be a close connection (both \isi{semantic} and \isi{phonological}) between these two elements, it is difficult to prove that they indeed form compounds. Although in sentences such as \REF{ex:verbs:106}, they are glossed as \isi{transitive} \isi{compound} verbs with \isi{direct object}s, they could alternatively be analyzed as series of \isi{postpositional phrase}s (which contain objects of the \isi{postposition}) and \isi{intransitive} verbs (having no objects of their own).

Sentence (with missing item): ndï=n u-nji uta ___
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL=OBL 2SG-POSS shell ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] put them in your dish.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The verb u- ‘put’ usually takes a \isi{goal} argument as its \isi{direct object} (i.e., it does not have the same \isi{semantics} or argument structure as \ili{English} put, \sectref{sec:9.2.2}). In \REF{ex:verbs:107}, the \isi{goal} argument directly precedes the possible \isi{compound} inu- ‘put in’.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They have just now cleared them.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The form watlo- ‘clear (as land of rubbish, foliage, etc.)’, composed of the \isi{postposition} wat ‘atop’ and a form of the verb lo- ‘cut’, is also possibly a \isi{compound}. Examples \REF{ex:verbs:108} and \REF{ex:verbs:109} illustrate watlo- ‘clear’ as it appears to function as a \isi{compound} verb.
