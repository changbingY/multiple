Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ na
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 3S.DO
The English translation of this sentence is:‘He slays it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Moloko has two kinds of transitive clauses -- transitive clauses with subject and direct object (\ref{ex:9:1}--\ref{ex:9:2}) and transitive clauses with subject and indirect object (\ref{ex:9:3}--\ref{ex:9:4}). These two grammatically different transitive clauses illustrate that the semantics of Moloko verbs allows three core participants (represented by subject, direct object, and indirect object). Moloko verbs do not have just Agent-Patient semantic frames for events. In this work we follow an Agent-Theme-Location analysis, as developed by \citet{DeLancey1991}, in which ‘Location’ (\LOC) has a particular definition. Indirect object always expresses semantic {\LOC} -- the participant that represents the place where the Theme is directed to. As such the indirect object can express (depending on the verb type, see Sections~\ref{sec:9.2.3}--\ref{sec:9.2.5}) the recipient or beneficiary of the event. Direct object always expresses semantic Theme, the core participant that changes position or state because of the event. Subject in transitive clauses expresses the Agent.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Hawa is at home.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Only one verb in Moloko can never take an object (neither direct nor indirect). The locational clause contains the verb nday. It states that the subject is presently located somewhere (\ref{ex:9:5}--\ref{ex:9:6}). An explicit free noun phrase subject is not required when this verb is the main predicate since the subject is indicated in the verb prefix; however an adpositional phrase giving the location is required and follows the verb. This same verb functions as a progressive aspect auxiliary (see \sectref{sec:8.2.1}).\footnote{It is interesting that the locational extension =aka is also used to express progressive aspect \sectref{sec:7.5.1}.}

Sentence (with missing item): awak ___ na haj=va
Gloss (with missing item): goat ___ 3S.DO millet=PRF
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The goat has eaten my millet.’ (lit. the goat has eaten to me the millet)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For some transitive verbs of this type, the indirect object (when present) marks the malefactive of the event. The indirect object will be negatively affected by the event. For the verb paɗ-ay ‘eat’ in \REF{ex:9:20} the subject (awak ‘goat’) ate the direct object (háy ‘millet’), incurring a negative effect on the indirect object (=aw ‘to me’).\footnote{This phenomenon is also known as possessor raising or external possession. We consider that the semantics for this construction in Moloko are malefactive rather than possessive because a possessive construction can also be employed (without an indirect object): awak a-paɗ-ay na háy əwla =va, ‘the goat ate my millet’. The construction with an indirect object connects the millet to its owner with less precision than the possessive construction, and concentrates on the loss that the owner incurred (due to the damages done to his millet field) rather than the fact that he owned the field.}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \citet{FriesenMathe morpheme ___lis2008} identified a unique group of verb constructions in Moloko. In these constructions, a special, sometimes phonologically reduced noun form that represents a part of the body is incorporated into the verb phrase. This is a case of noun incorporation where these body-part nouns are closely associated with the verb complex and their incorporation changes the lexical characteristics of the verb. These body-part nouns include the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___,’ (\ref{ex:9:45}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.3}), elé ‘eye,’ (\ref{ex:9:46}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.1}), sləthe morpheme ___y ‘ear,’ (\ref{ex:9:47}, \sectref{sec:9.3.1.2}), and va or har ‘body,’ (\ref{ex:9:48}, \ref{ex:9:49}, Sections~\ref{sec:9.3.1.4} and \ref{sec:9.3.1.5}, respectively).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘He/she calls the child again.’ (lit. he calls mouth to him to the child again)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The body-part noun follows directly after all other elements in the verb complex. It appears to be in the same position as any other noun phrase direct object in the verb phrase (see \chapref{chap:8}); however it is in more tightly bound to the verb complex than a noun phrase. The body-part noun does not fill the \DO pronominal slot, because verbal extensions that follow the \DO pronominal in the Moloko verb complex precede the body-part (see \ref{ex:9:45} and \ref{ex:9:47} which each have an adpositional extension, see \sectref{sec:7.5.1}). It is not phonologically bound to the verb since, unlike the Perfect verbal extension =va which is part of the verb complex, the body-part va does not neutralise the prosody on the verb stem \REF{ex:9:48}. However, the incorporated noun is gramthe morpheme ___tically closer to the verb complex than a noun phrase direct object would be because the body-part can never be separated from the verb complex. The body-part can never be fronted in the clause (see \sectref{sec:8.1}). Nor can the body-part be separated from the verb complex by the presupposition the morpheme ___rker.

Sentence (with missing item): ta-ndalaj ta-l=ala tɪ-ɮɪg-ɛ ___ ana Mʊlɔkʷɔ=ahaj
Gloss (with missing item): 3P-PRG 3P-go=to 3P-throw-CL ___ DAT Moloko=Pl
The English translation of this sentence is:‘They were coming and fighting with the Molokos.’ (lit. they were coming they threw body to Molokos)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The its gloss ___-part noun follows directly after all other elements in the verb complex. It appears to be in the same position as any other noun phrase direct object in the verb phrase (see \chapref{chap:8}); however it is in more tightly bound to the verb complex than a noun phrase. The its gloss ___-part noun does not fill the \DO pronominal slot, because verbal extensions that follow the \DO pronominal in the Moloko verb complex precede the its gloss ___-part (see \ref{ex:9:45} and \ref{ex:9:47} which each have an adpositional extension, see \sectref{sec:7.5.1}). It is not phonologically bound to the verb since, unlike the Perfect verbal extension =the morpheme ___ which is part of the verb complex, the its gloss ___-part the morpheme ___ does not neutralise the prosody on the verb stem \REF{ex:9:48}. However, the incorporated noun is grammatically closer to the verb complex than a noun phrase direct object would be because the its gloss ___-part can never be separated from the verb complex. The its gloss ___-part can never be fronted in the clause (see \sectref{sec:8.1}). Nor can the its gloss ___-part be separated from the verb complex by the presupposition marker. Both of these situations can occur for noun phrase direct objects and are illustrated in \sectref{sec:11.2} (\ref{ex:9:29} and \ref{ex:9:30}).
A: word: va	 gloss: body

Question 19:
You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Mala a-mənzar ___
Gloss (with missing item): Mala 3S-see ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Mala looks around attentively.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The body-part noun elé ‘its gloss ___’ collocates with some verbs to lexicalise the engagement of the its gloss ___s and reduce the focus on what is seen. This body-part word is used in its full form. For example, the verb mənjar normally means ‘see’ (see \tabref{tab:76}). With the incorporation of elé (\ref{ex:9:52}-- \ref{ex:9:53}), the verb plus body-part construction has a more active experiential meaning in that the subject of the clause (Mala) is looking around attentively. Since there can be no direct object, there is no explicit referential object as stimulus -- the speaker is vague about what exactly Mala will look at.
A: word: ɛlɛ	 gloss: eye
B: word: ɛlɛ=ahaŋ	 gloss: thing=3S.POSS
C: word: dəraj	 gloss: head
D: word: ɬəmaj	 gloss: ear

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The body-part noun elé ‘its gloss ___’ collocates with some verbs to lexicalise the engagement of the its gloss ___s and reduce the focus on what is seen. This body-part word is used in its full form. For example, the verb mənjar normally means ‘see’ (see \tabref{tab:76}).

Sentence (with missing item): Mana \'{ɛ}-tʃɛŋ ___ baj
Gloss (with missing item): Mana 3S+IFV-hear ___ NEG
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Mana is deaf/disobedient.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For example, the normal lexical meaning of the verb cen is ‘hits gloss ___’ or ‘understand’ \REF{ex:9:55} and the verb is bitransitive (see \sectref{sec:9.2.4}). The incorporation of the body-part sləmay ‘its gloss ___’ gives a much more active or intensive idea -- not just hits gloss ___ and understand someone, but also listen to them or obey them \REF{ex:9:56}. The focus is on the fact that the person is benefitting from using his its gloss ___s to intently listen, rather than on the person speaking or the content of their message.
