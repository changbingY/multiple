Sentence (with missing item): nzun etha nzüthamöwä ___ wath.
Gloss (with missing item): FSG.DAT three times ___ dance.
The English translation of this sentence is:`They danced three times for me.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \Alph{} prefixes combine only with the extended stem. They are used to encode \isi{non-past} (\ref{ex276}), \isi{recent past} \isi{durative} (\ref{ex275}) and \isi{past} \isi{imperfective} (\ref{ex277}). Example (\ref{ex276}) comes from a hunting story, where the narrator meets a spiritual being in the forest. In (\ref{ex275}), the speaker reports an incident from a neighbouring village involving a young boy who was attacked by a sorcerer in his yam garden. Example (\ref{ex277}), is from an interview about the customs around the sister-exchange marriage system.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The story which I have just told passed from the ancestors to (our) fathers.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If the \isi{proclitic} n= is attached to a \isi{verb} employing the \Alph{} prefixes, the resulting inflection is either \isi{immediate past} imperfective (\ref{ex273}) or \isi{immediate past} \isi{durative} (\ref{ex274}) depending on the suffixal material. In other words, the \isi{immediate past} is built from verbs inflected for \isi{non-past}. This is preserved in the integrated glossing style, because the n= is analysed as a \isi{clitic}. The n= is related to the \isi{imminent} \isi{particle} n ({\S}\ref{imminentm}). Example (\ref{ex273}) sums up a story about the origin of the Morehead people. In (\ref{ex274}), the speaker talks about competitive yam cultivation and how older people assess a young man's status by the number and size of his crop.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The second formative for the second singular in \tabref{perspref2} (nz-) is used for \isi{irrealis} inflection of prefixing and ambifixing verbs. Interestingly, only the second \isi{person} singular of ambifixing verbs does not employ the \isi{irrealis} prefix ra- in the \isi{irrealis} inflection (\ref{ex286}). If it is a prefixing verb, the \isi{irrealis} prefix ra- is employed (\ref{ex287}).\footnote{Both verbs in this example are deponent employing, the valency change prefix a- without a change in valency. The second verb yak `walk' is only deponent when it employs the venitive marker, meaning `come', not when it is neutral or andative `walk', `go away'.} Example (\ref{ex286}) is taken from a procedural text in which the speaker shows me how to manufacture two children's toys.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{durative} suffix can also attach to an \isi{iterative} inflection, in which case the iteration of the event is streched over a longer duration, as in (\ref{ex295}) and (\ref{ex296}). In (\ref{ex295}), the speaker talks about the first fire which destroyed the world inhabited by humans. In (\ref{ex296}), the speaker describes how the people used to avoid a particular place during the early and late hours of the day because it was inhabited by a story man.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They would hit him on the head with the long yam (and say) ``Now you come up with a plan to pay this back!'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{durative} suffix -m can be suffixed to perfective verbs in the \isi{recent past}, \isi{past} and \isi{irrealis}. In this case, the event is only \isi{backgrounded} without encoding a longer duration. However, these inflections are so rare that, at least for the \isi{recent past} and \isi{past} tenses, they are not attested in the corpus. For the \isi{irrealis} \isi{perfective} with the \isi{durative} suffix, there are a handful of examples. In (\ref{ex297}), the speaker talks about an old procedure for punishment which involved striking the culprit with a yam tuber over the head.\footnote{I will show the backgrounded status of the perfective verb in the unified gloss line with \Bg{}, as in the examples below. In the maximally segmented gloss line, I will continue to use the durative label \Dur{}.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`We do not know where it will finish ... in which generation it will finish.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Irrespective of perfectivity, the \isi{durative} suffix on any \isi{irrealis} inflection can have a far \isi{future} interpretation. In examples (\ref{ex298}) and (\ref{ex299}), it is clear from the context that the event is set in the \isi{future} and the -m on the verb indicates that the event is further in the \isi{future} (as opposed to an \isi{irrealis} form without the -m suffix). In (\ref{ex298}), the speaker showed me an old method of tying a bowstring. He then speculates whether and when these old practices will vanish. Example (\ref{ex299}) is taken from a conversation about yam cultivation during which the speaker complains about young people's lack of interest in gardening.

The English translation of this sentence is:`When they have just held your big (yam tubers) and say: ``Hey, that (is) a big one!'' then you have to be afraid!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If the \isi{durative} suffix is attached to a \isi{verb} in the \isi{imperative} mood, it encodes a delayed or \isi{future} \isi{imperative} (`do X a little later!').\footnote{I gloss the future imperative with \Futimp{} in the unified gloss line.} The \isi{future} \isi{imperative} is also a rare inflection, and we have seen one text example in (\ref{ex274}) on page \pageref{ex274}. In example (\ref{ex300}), the speaker describes how competitive yam harvesting took place in the old days.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Now you are here. You stay here until I return.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Here I describe the morphology of imperatives for the prefixing template. Prefixing verbs as defined here encode their single \isi{participant} in the prefix. We saw in \tabref{perspref2} on page \pageref{perspref2} that imperatives are formed with the \Bet{} \isi{prefix series}. For prefixing verbs, the formatives are gn- (\Ssg.\Imp) and th- (\Snsg.\Imp). A further suffix is added to prefixing verbs only. Consider example (\ref{ex301}) in which the speaker quotes himself talking to his wife. The \isi{imperative} inflected \isi{verb} is marked with an -é suffix which resembles the actor suffix of an ambifixing \isi{imperfective} \isi{imperative} (\Ssg.\Imp) or of an ambifixing indicative of any \isi{aspect} class (\Fsg). In the morphological context of prefixing imperatives, this -é does not encode a \isi{person} value, as can be seen in example (\ref{ex302}) where the number of the addressee argument is \isi{plural}. In other words, the -é suffix looks like a \isi{person}/\isi{number} suffix, but with prefixing verbs it is inert to those categories and it only encodes \isi{imperative} mood.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{imminent} \isi{particle} n expresses the point in time just before the event takes place, usually without implying that it actually happened. This often gets translated by informants as `try to do X' or `be about to do X'. Both interpretations, the intentional and the imminent one, are possible and difficult to separate. In example (\ref{ex307}), the speaker showed me how to weave a fish basket. He says that he will try and fetch me when the work is finished because he does not know whether or not it will be successful.\footnote{Indeed, he never came and showed me the finished fish basket because I had already left the village.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Later I will try and fetch you, when I have finished that big (basket).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is an overlap in the semantics of the \isi{proclitic} n= which encodes \isi{immediate past} and the \isi{imminent} \isi{particle} n. I pointed out earlier that the \isi{immediate past} \isi{clitic} attaches to a verb which is otherwise inflected for \isi{non-past}. Thus, it marks a point in time immediately before the present. The \isi{particle} n occurs in front of verb forms of different TAM categories, marking a point in time immediately before the event. The semantic difference is in the implication as to whether or not the event was actually carried out. In the case of the \isi{immediate} \isi{clitic}, the event has happened, but with the \isi{particle} n this is not the case. The difference between the two also lies in formal criteria. The \isi{particle} n is syntactically independent in that it occurs free (\ref{ex307}), or occur directly in front of the verb, where it is hard to say whether it is a \isi{proclitic} or an independent element (\ref{ex308}). On the other hand, the \isi{immediate} \isi{clitic} n= is always bound to the verb.

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ni w-mäg-n-e zöbthé.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ FNSG TSG.F.ALPH-lead.EXT-DU-FNSG first.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Where are they? We will lead (the path) first.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I point out in {\S}\ref{deicticcliticssection} that among the \isi{deictic} proclitics there is one with a limited distribution. The m= \isi{proclitic} can only attach to the copula, in which case it turns the clause into a \isi{question} (`where is X?').\footnote{I will gloss m as interrogative (where=) when it attaches to the copula. I will gloss it as apprehensive (\Appr) in all other cases, including the cases where m and the potential particle kma express a prohibitive.} See example (\ref{ex271}) on page \pageref{ex271}. The m \isi{particle} shows more syntactic flexibility as it can procliticise to the \isi{verb} as m=, encliticise to the \isi{potential} \isi{particle} in the combination kma=m or occur by itself. The latter is only attested through elicitation and there are no corpus examples of independent m. Nevertheless, it can be classified as a \isi{particle} and a \isi{clitic}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They said: ``Grab him! Hold him! He might ignite the Kidn fire. (That is) when we will all burn.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{particle} m functions as an \isi{apprehensive} marker. It is attested in the corpus with irrealis, imperative and perfective forms. Example (\ref{ex303}) is from a story about a man who mocked a crowd of dancers by threatening them with a matchbox.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They said: ``Grab him! Hold him! He might ignite the Kidn fire. (That is) when we will all burn.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In these cases, the \isi{particle} m seems to override the TAM value of the verb. In (\ref{ex303}), the verb is in the \isi{recent past} but lacks a the\isi{recent past} reading. Likewise, I often heard the warning mkätr\footnote{\parbox{0.02cm}{\hfill}\parbox{6cm}{mkätr}\\ \parbox{0.05cm}{\hfill}\parbox{6cm}{m=k-ä-tr-\Zero}\\ \parbox{0.05cm}{\hfill}\parbox{6cm}{\Appr=\M.\Bet-\Vc.\Ndu-fall.\Rs-\Ssg.{\Imp}}} `(watch out) you might fall!', where m is attached to an \isi{imperative} form, but lacks an \isi{imperative} reading. Naturally, if m occurs with an irrealis form, there is no such conflict. Example (\ref{ex304}) is taken from a story about a bushfire. The speaker explains how he set a small controlled fire in order to stop the wild bushfire from spreading.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: If m occurs with an \isi{imperative} inflected verb and the \isi{potential} kma, it functions as a prohibitive.

The English translation of this sentence is:`You must not come here for sex tonight!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the prohibitive construction, the \isi{particle} m is rather flexible. It can attach to the verb as a \isi{proclitic} (\ref{ex306}) or to the \isi{potential} \isi{particle} the morpheme ___ as an \isi{enclitic} (\ref{ex305} and \ref{ex383}). What is important for the prohibitive reading is the co-occurence of m and the morpheme ___ in the clause, not the fact that they are conjoined. Example (\ref{ex306})\footnote{The verb yak ‘walk’ is deponent and employs the valency change prefix a- without a change in the valency of the verb. It is only deponent when it employs the venitive marker, meaning ‘come’, not when it is neutral or andative, meaning ‘walk’, ‘go away’.} comes from a public speech at a dance in which the speaker tells the audience the rules for the night.

You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): be ___ ŋazi=karä k-a-thafrak-w-é.
Gloss (with missing item): SSG.ERG ___ coconut=PROP M.BET-VC.-mix.EXT-NDU-SSG.IMP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`You must not mix it with coconut'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the prohibitive construction, the \isi{particle} m is rather flexible. It can attach to the verb as a \isi{proclitic} (\ref{ex306}) or to the \isi{potential} \isi{particle} kma as an \isi{enclitic} (\ref{ex305} and \ref{ex383}). What is important for the prohibitive reading is the co-occurence of m and kma in the clause, not the fact that they are conjoined. Example (\ref{ex306})\footnote{The verb yak ‘walk’ is deponent and employs the valency change prefix a- without a change in the valency of the verb. It is only deponent when it employs the venitive marker, meaning ‘come’, not when it is neutral or andative, meaning ‘walk’, ‘go away’.} comes from a public speech at a dance in which the speaker tells the audience the rules for the night. Example (\ref{ex383}) is taken from a text about food taboos.
A: word: kma=m	 gloss: Pot=Appr
B: word: nima=me	 gloss: like.this=INS
C: word: kma	 gloss: Pot

The English translation of this sentence is:`It should have been well today, if we had straightened things out in a good way.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{potential} \isi{particle} the morpheme ___ is used to encode various types of speculation and counterfactuality with deontic or epistemic interpretation. Example (\ref{ex331}) is taken from a public speech at a dance, where the guest side has brought too many people, and consequently the host side found it impossible to meet the needs of so many people. The speaker regrets that no proper arrangement has been made prior to the event. Thus, the clause ``it should have been well'' has a clear deontic reading.
A: word: kma	 gloss: Pot
B: word: kma=m	 gloss: Pot=Appr
C: word: nafa-fäms=f	 gloss: Third.POSS-exchange.man=ERG.SG

The English translation of this sentence is:`Yes, (I have) already.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I adopt the term ``\isi{iamitive}'' from Olsson's (\citeyear{Olsson:2013vn}) comparative study of particles that express a perfect. Reesink (\citeyear[184]{Reesink:2009bird}) uses the term ``perspectival \isi{aspect}'', which he adopts from Dik (\citeyear{Dik:1997uj}). Komnthe morpheme ___o speakers often translate the \isi{iamitive} \isi{particle} the morpheme ___ as `already', hence the \isi{gloss} label {\Iam}. An introductory example is given in (\ref{ex311}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`Have you shown him zuyak (Rhodania sp) already?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I adopt the term ``\isi{iamitive}'' from Olsson's (\citeyear{Olsson:2013vn}) comparative study of particles that express a perfect.

Gloss (with missing item): Third.ABS DIST.All STNSG.BETaone-VC.-sit.EXT-NDU-DUR like.this ... FNSG masu=LOC ___ FNSG.BETaone-VC.-sit.EXT-NDU-DUR.
The English translation of this sentence is:`They lived over there, this way ... and we had already been living in Masu.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex311}) shows that the function of the \isi{iamitive} is to express ``current relevance'' of some past event. Consequently, the \isi{particle} may combine with verbs inflected for different TAM categories. Example (\ref{ex311}) shows a verb in \isi{recent past} \isi{perfective}. In (\ref{ex332}), the \isi{iamitive} \isi{particle} is used with a \isi{past} \isi{durative} inflected verb. This combination is rarer, but well-attested in the corpus. In the example, the speaker is explaining which clans settled at which locations. He points out that his clan had already been living in Masu for a while.

Gloss (with missing item): night MED far=EMPH STNSG.ALPH-VC.-sit.EXT-NDU-ANDAT ___ FSG.ALPH-VC.-VENIT-hear.EXT-NDU-STNSG.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Tonight you are sitting too far away. Can you hear me?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{iamitive} \isi{particle} can also be used with a \isi{non-past} inflection. This is often restricted to interrogatives, as in (\ref{ex314}), where the speaker is asking a crowd of people whether they can hear him speaking.
A: word: z	 gloss: IAM
B: word: komnzo	 gloss: only

The English translation of this sentence is:`It turned off (the path) there ... I walked in the bushy place until I arrived here in Tümgo.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{iamitive} \isi{particle} additionally expresses the completion of an event. Evidence for this come from different observations. First, it can express a current relevance meaning. Secondly, it never combines with \isi{iterative} verbs, which express an ongoing repetition of some event in the past. Thirdly, it marks sequentiality of events in some narratives where the verb form which combines with it seems to be almost a prerequisite to the following verb. Example (\ref{ex333})\footnote{The verb yak ‘walk’ is deponent and employs the valency changing prefix a- without a change in the valency of the verb. Note that this occurs only with the venitive marker, in which case the verb means ‘come’, not when it is neutral (‘walk’) or marked with the andative (‘go away’).} is a description of a path, which the speaker had taken the previous day. He describes the sequenced stages of his path to the location called Tümgo.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The cockatoo bird used to sit on top (of the tree), and told him always: ``Oh, a man is coming.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{habitual} \isi{particle} the morpheme ___ typically combines with \isi{durative} inflections. In example (\ref{ex315}), the cockatoo always warns the protagonist of another man who comes and visits him.
A: word: nomai	 gloss: Hab

Gloss (with missing item): NEG ___ M.GAM-VC..NDU-sit.EXT-PST-STNSG.
The English translation of this sentence is:`They did not stay (there) for long.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{habitual} can also combine with verb forms inflected for other TAM categories, such as imperfectives (\ref{ex316}). It only occasionally occurs with perfectives, as in (\ref{ex317}), where the event is negated. In both examples, the morpheme ___ expresses an extended period of time rather that a repeated habit.
A: word: nomai	 gloss: Hab
B: word: nomair	 gloss: Hab
C: word: kwa	 gloss: FUT
D: word: e-kn-n-e	 gloss: STNSG.Alph-roll.EXT-DU-FNSG

The English translation of this sentence is:`I said: ``That dog disturbed me there and therefore I pushed him into the water. Well, full of fear he ran back here.'''
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{temporal} reference of the \isi{immediate past} and the \isi{recent past} overlaps. The \isi{immediate past} is used for events that took place a short while prior to the time of speaking, and it may be used to put extra emphasis on that fact. The \isi{recent past} covers the same period of time, but it reaches further back, usually to the preceding day. Example (\ref{ex374}) is taken from a hunting story, at the end of which the speaker returns home to find one of his dogs. He tells his wife that this is the dog which had disturbed him at the outset of the trip when he was about to cross the Morehead river. He had pushed the dog into the water, whereupon the poor dog ran back to the house. The whole episode in (\ref{ex374}) is set in the same time frame with respect to the moment of speech. Only the `pushing in the water' is expressed in the \isi{immediate past}, while the other two verb forms are in the \isi{recent past}.\footnote{The speaker uses the nz= formative of the immediate past clitic.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Yesterday, I set off from there towards here ... to Kanathr.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The bidirectional time adverbials discussed in {\S}\ref{temporals-sec} help to identify the appropriate time frames for each \isi{tense} value. The term the morpheme ___ expresses a moment in time which is removed by one day from the present time. Thus, the morpheme ___ can mean `tomorrow', when used with a non-past inflection, or it can mean `its gloss ___', when used with a \isi{recent past}. Events further back in time have to be expressed by the \isi{past} \isi{tense}. Likewise, one cannot use a \isi{recent past} with the time adverbial nama, which indicates a point in time that is removed two days from the present time (`day before its gloss ___' or `day after tomorrow'). In short, the \isi{recent past} reaches back one day, whereas the \isi{past} \isi{tense} covers everything before its gloss ___, irrespective of whether it happened a week ago or in ancestral time. Example (\ref{ex375}) shows the use of the morpheme ___ and the \isi{recent past}. Example (\ref{ex376}) shows the use of nama and the \isi{past} \isi{tense}.\footnote{Nama can also be used metaphorically to mean `recently'.}

Example (\ref{ex668}) comes from a story that took place in the speaker's youth. In the example clauses, he describes walking with a friend during night time. The two boys rested along the way and smoked tobacco. Although the story is set in the past, only the first and the last verbs in (\ref{ex668}) are inflected in the past \isi{tense} (`walk' in both cases). The `sitting down' and the `setting off' are inflected for irrealis, and are thus tenseless. The rolling of the cigarettes and their smoking is told in the \isi{non-past}, which moves this part to the foreground.

Sentence (with missing item): fthé ___ gwonyame=n o festh=en o wämne=n ... keke kwa s-ra-nor.

The English translation of this sentence is:`If you hit it on clothes, body or a tree, it will not make a sound.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Aspect in Komnzo seems to concentrate more on a punctual/inceptive versus ongoing/{\linebreak}stretched-out distinction. I adopt the traditional labels \isi{perfective} for the former and \isi{imperfective} for the latter. The degree to which an event is ``stretched out'' would then decide whether the speaker chooses the \isi{imperfective} or \isi{durative} \isi{aspect}. The basic binary distinction is clearest in the \isi{imperative} forms. The \isi{imperfective} imperatives often encode an ongoing action and, depending on the context, they can be translated as ``keep on X-ing'' or ``do X for some time''. Perfective imperatives, on the other hand, express inception ``start X-ing'' or punctuality ``do X once/quickly''. In example (\ref{ex373}), the speaker has just produced a toy bullroarer from a coconut leaf and shows me how to hold it properly. In (\ref{ex372}), she tells me not to hit anything while swinging, and the \isi{imperative} of `hit' is in the \isi{perfective}.\footnote{This is a conditional construction which frequently employs imperative inflections together with fthé `when/if' ({\S}\ref{TAMsemmood} and \S\ref{condiclauses}).} In (\ref{ex371}), she is already swinging the bullroarer, telling me to hold it away from the body. Consequently, all the \isi{imperative} verb forms (`hold', `blow', and `swing') are in the \isi{imperfective}.

Question 90:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): yame=märe fthé ___ ... etfth=r.
Gloss (with missing item): mat=PRIV when ___ ... sleep=PURP.
The English translation of this sentence is:`If you go without a mat, (this one is) for sleeping.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Imperatives can be used in a number of ways that fall outside the definition of `giving an order'. In example (\ref{ex318}), the speaker showed me the leaves of a pandanus plant pointing out that I can use the leaves to sleep on. The \isi{imperative} form gnyaké `you go' is thus not a command `go without a mat', but more like a conditional `if you go without a mat'. The conditional interpretation also comes from the word fthé which means `when' or `at the time when'. This type of conditional construction is an extended use of the \isi{imperative} inflection. Most imperatives are used as commands, and there are conditional constructions without \isi{imperative} inflections.

Sentence (with missing item): katan kwa ___ ... kafar minzü yé.
Gloss (with missing item): small FUT ___ ... big very TSG.MASC.COP.NDU.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I will make it smaller. This is too big.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As we have seen in {\S}\ref{irrealisra}, the irrealis is marked by the prefix ra-. There is no \isi{realis} marker, hence no realis inflection. Beyond counterfactuality and futurity, the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} has a number of semantic extensions in Komnzo. Cross-linguistically \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} is employed for a wide range of functions, which has led some authors to challenge its validity as a comparative category (\citealt{Bybee:irrealis}). Others have suggested a prototype approach to \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood}, for example Givon (\citeyear[327]{Givon:1994ko}). I will adopt the latter here. Example (\ref{ex381}) and (\ref{ex382}) show the \isi{irrealis} \isi{mood} in its more central functions, counterfactuality and futurity, respectively. Examples (\ref{ex381}) is taken from a headhunting story which involved the speaker's father.\footnote{The example also shows the `relative use' of the immediate past. Although the events in the story happened a long time ago, the speaker uses the immediate past (niyamnzrm `He was staying just before') to emphasise that the headhunt took place just after his father had left the village.} Example (\ref{ex382}) is taken from a procedural in which the speaker shows me how to make a toy from a coconut leaf.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I fell asleep (for) a daytime nap. I was sleeping until the late afternoon ... and I woke up.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Ir\isi{realis} \isi{mood} is frequently used in narratives which report factual truths. Foley (\citeyear[389]{Foley:2000uh}) points out that Papuan languages often employ the realis-irrealis distinction for pragmatic purposes. In Komnzo, the pragmatic use comes from the alternation between \isi{irrealis} and \isi{realis} inflections especially in event sequencing. In this pattern, the \isi{irrealis} is used for backgrounding. Example (\ref{ex377}) is taken from a hunting story that occured many years ago. The story is told from a first-person perspective, thus, there is no reason to question the factual truth of what is being told. The clauses in (\ref{ex377}) describe a sequence of events: fall asleep > be sleeping > wake up. Only the foregrounded clause (`sleep') is expressed in \isi{realis} (\isi{past} \isi{durative}), whereas the \isi{backgrounded} clauses (`fall asleep' and `wake up') are expressed in \isi{irrealis} (\isi{perfective}). In that sense, the \isi{irrealis} verb forms act as a backgrounding bracket around the foregrounded clause.\footnote{Note that example (\ref{ex668}) on page \pageref{ex668} employs the same bracket-like use of the irrealis inflected verb forms. The only difference is that in (\ref{ex668}), the foregrounded event is in the non-past, whereas in (\ref{ex377}) the foregrounded event is in past durative.}

In this pattern, the \isi{irrealis} is used for backgrounding. Example (\ref{ex377}) is taken from a hunting story that occured many years ago. The story is told from a first-person perspective, thus, there is no reason to question the factual truth of what is being told. The clauses in (\ref{ex377}) describe a sequence of events: fall asleep > be sleeping > wake up. Only the foregrounded clause (`sleep') is expressed in \isi{realis} (\isi{past} \isi{durative}), whereas the \isi{backgrounded} clauses (`fall asleep' and `wake up') are expressed in \isi{irrealis} (\isi{perfective}). In that sense, the \isi{irrealis} verb forms act as a backgrounding bracket around the foregrounded clause.\footnote{Note that example (\ref{ex668}) on page \pageref{ex668} employs the same bracket-like use of the irrealis inflected verb forms. The only difference is that in (\ref{ex668}), the foregrounded event is in the non-past, whereas in (\ref{ex377}) the foregrounded event is in past durative.}

Question 101:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ efoth etfth kwof-rugr-m e zizi ... k-rä-bnaf-é.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ sun sleep FSG.Betatwo-sleep.EXT.NDU-DUR until afternoon ... M.BET-IRR.VC..NDU-wake.up.RS-FSG.
The English translation of this sentence is:`I fell asleep (for) a daytime nap. I was sleeping until the late afternoon ... and I woke up.'
