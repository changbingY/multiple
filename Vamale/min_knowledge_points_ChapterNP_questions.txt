Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This is typical of canonic Oceanic languages \parencite[495]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}. Free pronouns can be flagged, like nouns, for the roles of transitive subject and intransitive subject, both obligatorily with the morpheme ___ \qu{\gl{sbj}}, while nouns can omit the morpheme ___ in intransitive scenarios, see (\ref{ex:opt_the morpheme ___}). Personal pronouns can be flagged as oblique, but they cannot be used as undergoer arguments, contrary to nouns and demonstrative pronouns, e.g. ena and nienaen. Flagging is discussed in \sectref{sec:Casmark}.

Sentence (with missing item): i=hun-saxhuti i=jaxhut nyanya-n-eong ___ caacaa-n-eong
Gloss (with missing item): DEF.SG=NMLZ-narrate DEF.SG=story mother-POSS-1SG.POSS ___ father-POSS-1SG.POSS
The English translation of this sentence is:my father's way of telling my mother's story
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In nominalizations as well, the morpheme ___ \qu{\gl{sbj}} obligatorily occurs to mark A (\ref{ex:nmlz-the morpheme ___1}, \ref{a the morpheme ___ yo}). P may take a different the morpheme ___ \qu{\gl{link}} when it is the only participant present in the construction (\ref{ex:nmlz-the morpheme ___2}). If several participants co-occur, this option disappears, as the clause would otherwise become confusing. As this the morpheme ___ only marks S and P, I gloss it subsequently as absolutive (see \sectref{the morpheme ___n}).
A: word: ka	 gloss: SBJ
B: word: ka-n	 gloss: FOC.POSS-ANA
C: word: ka=go	 gloss: SBJ=2SG

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nouns are mostly quantified with verbs. Numbers are expressed through verbs, as are forms like hmai-n \qu{many} in (\ref{ex:hmain}) and the derived middle form \mbox{e-hmai-n} \qu{more and more (countable)} (see \sectref{ssec:MID_unbounded}). Non-verbal quantifiers include jaa \qu{much}, mu \qu{few (uncountable)} as well as meeka-n, all signifying uncountable and thus generic masses: jaa apuli \qu{too many people}, mu mwani \qu{little money}, meeka li=apuli \qu{all the people}.
