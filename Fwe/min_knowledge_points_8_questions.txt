Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): shunu ___
Gloss (with missing item): today ___
The English translation of this sentence is:‘Today, I am working. / Today, I will work.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: That the present construction only specifies that the event nucleus extends beyond UT, and does not specify if it overlaps with UT, may suggest that the label “present” is incorrect, and that an analysis of this construction as future is more suitable. There are, however, a number of reasons why a present analysis is preferred. Fwe has two future constructions (see \sectref{bkm:Ref463007186}), whose basic criteria are that the nucleus is situated in its entirety after UT: their only possible interpretation is future. This contrasts with the present construction, where overlap with UT is optional, and both future and present interpretations are possible. This difference is illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref468114262}--\ref{bkm:Ref74908034}): the present construction in (\ref{bkm:Ref468114262}) can either be interpreted as indicating that the speaker already started working, or that he will start working. The near future construction in (\ref{bkm:Ref74908034}), however, can only indicate that the speaker has not yet started working, but will start working later the same day.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘When you eat too much, you become fat.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Linked to their modal interpretation in main clauses, change-of-state verbs in the present construction are also often used in the apodosis of a factual conditional, expressing an event that will come to pass if certain conditions are met, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref99094967}--\ref{bkm:Ref99094968}).

The English translation of this sentence is:‘S/he is in the house, s/he is washing dishes.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The difference between the present progressive and aspectually unmarked present also relates to modality. With the present progressive, the speaker expresses certainty that the event is taking place at UT, but the aspectually unmarked present may leave more doubt about whether the action fully overlaps with UT. This contrast is illustrated in (\ref{bkm:Ref467676720}--\ref{bkm:Ref72239269}), which both answer the question: ‘Where is that person?’. In (\ref{bkm:Ref72239269}), the aspectually unmarked present is used to imply that the person is supposed to wash dishes, but may at this very moment be busy with something else. In (\ref{bkm:Ref467676720}), the use of a present progressive implies that the person referred to is currently, without a doubt, busy washing dishes.
