Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The main verb of relative clauses, whether in participial (\ref{ex:kWkWngo.kWkAkWnAndza}) or in finite form (\ref{ex:pWpaGWtndZi}, \ref{ex:tWtAfsea}), can undergo reduplication of the first syllable (§\ref{sec:verb.initial.redp}) to express universal quantification of the relativized element, whose syntactic function can be object (\ref{ex:pWpaGWtndZi}), semi-object (\ref{ex:tWtAfsea}) or intransitive subject (\ref{ex:kWkWngo.kWkAkWnAndza}), and even transitive subject (\ref{ex:qartshaz.pWpWkWmtshAm}) (however some transitive subject participle cannot undergo initial reduplication for morphological reasons, see §\ref{sec:totalitative.redp}).

Gloss (with missing item): LNK 3SG most ___ 3SG.POSS-OBJ:PCP-APPL-like DEM
The English translation of this sentence is:`The place that it likes most...'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The transitive subject in these constructions is formally a possessor, external to the relative clause. In (\ref{ex:stu.WsAtCha.WkAnWrga}) in particular, the presence of the degree adverb \japhug{stu}{most} (§\ref{sec:stu.superlative}) between the pronoun \forme{ɯʑo} and the head noun \forme{the morpheme ___} `its place' is a clue that \forme{ɯʑo} is not included in the relative clause.
A: word: ɯ-sɤtɕʰa	 gloss: 3SG.POSS-place
B: word: nɤ-sɤtɕʰa	 gloss: 2SG.POSS-place

Gloss (with missing item): LNK 3SG.POSS-clothes PL IFR-take.off LNK FILLER old.woman ERG ___ AOR-OBJ:PCP-give DEM:PL IFR-take.off LNK
The English translation of this sentence is:`He took off his clothes, he took off the (magical) clothes that the old woman had given him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In relative clauses, the possessor of inalienably possessed nouns can be neutralized to the indefinite possessor prefix \forme{tɯ-/tɤ-} (§\ref{sec:indef.genr.poss}), even when the possessor is definite. In (\ref{ex:tWNga.nWkAmbi}) for example, the possessor of \forme{-ŋga} `clothes' is the transitive subject of both sentences (the main character of the story), and is marked with the \textsc{3sg} prefix \forme{ɯ-} in the first sentence. In the second sentence, the noun \forme{-ŋga} is located in a head-internal relative clause (§\ref{sec:semi.object.relativization}), and even though the possessor is the same as in the previous sentence, the indefinite prefix \forme{tɯ-} appears.
A: word: tɯ-ŋga	 gloss: INDEF.POSS-clothes
B: word: ɯ-ŋga	 gloss: 3SG.POSS-clothes
C: word: tɯ-ɕa	 gloss: INDEF.POSS-flesh
D: word: ɯ-cu	 gloss: 3SG.POSS-additive

Gloss (with missing item): INDEF.POSS-present AOR-give-PST:TR-1SG ___ DEM 1SG.POSS-son be:FACT
The English translation of this sentence is:`The child to whom I gave a present is my son.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In relative clauses (whether participial or finite ones), it is possible to index the agent like in main clauses (\ref{ex:apAro.relative}), but possessor neutralization is also possible, as in (\ref{ex:tApAro.relative}).
A: word: tɤ-rɟit	 gloss: INDEF.POSS-child
B: word: cʰɤ-rɤ-rɟit	 gloss: IFR-DENOM-child

The English translation of this sentence is:`There was a very evil king.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In head-internal and postnominal relatives, postnominal determiners such as the indefinte marker \forme{ci} (§\ref{sec:indef.article}) or the demonstrative \forme{nɯ} (§\ref{sec:nW.topic}) can appear both on the internal head noun and repeated following the relative clause. In (\ref{ex:rJAlpu.ci.kWNAn.ci}) for instance, \forme{ci} occurs after the noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{its gloss ___} and at the end of the relative after the participle \forme{kɯ-ŋɤn} `(the one) who is evil'.
A: word: rɟɤlpu	 gloss: king

The English translation of this sentence is:`It eats all of the clothes that are made of [animal] hair.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the head noun of the relative is overt, it can occur within the relative at the position that would be expected in the corresponding independent sentence: for instance, the noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{clothes} is located between the instrumental adjunct and the verb both in the head-internal relative in (\ref{ex:tWNga.thWkABzu}) and in the independent clause in (\ref{ex:tWNga.chWBzunW}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`The information that my son has brought is pleasing.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the relativized element is a noun such as \japhug{the morpheme ___}{information, news} or \japhug{ftɕaka}{method} which can take adnominal complements (§\ref{sec:complement.taking.nouns}), only head-internal relatives are possible, as prenominal clauses are interpreted as complements instead of relatives. For instance, the head noun \forme{the morpheme ___} in (\ref{ex:tWtCha.jAkAGWt}) cannot be moved after the participle: \dagger\forme{a-tɕɯ kɯ jɤ-kɤ-ɣɯt \textbf{the morpheme ___} nɯ} is not accepted.

Gloss (with missing item): ___ AOR-OBJ:PCP-turn.upside.down EMPH SENS-be.like
The English translation of this sentence is:`It looks like a bowl that has been turned upside down.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Since Japhug has strict verb-final order (§\ref{sec:basic.word.order}), in head-internal relative clauses the verb follows the head noun, as it would in a postnominal relative. In many cases it is indeed impossible to ascertain whether the head-noun belongs or not to the relative. For instance, in (\ref{ex:khWtsa.pWkABRum}) \forme{the morpheme ___ pɯ-kɤ-βʁum} `a its gloss ___ that has been turned upside down' there is no clear evidence for analyzing the head noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{its gloss ___} as internal or external to the relative.
A: word: kʰɯtsa	 gloss: bowl

The English translation of this sentence is:`A boy who was riding a bicycle arrived.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: However, with other types of relative clauses there is sometimes positive evidence that the head noun is internal. When the function of the relativized element is that of transitive subject (§\ref{sec:tr.subject.relativization}), the presence of ergative marking can be a criterion for analyzing it as relative-internal. In (\ref{ex:WkWnWmbrApW}) for instance, the phrase \forme{the morpheme ___ ci kɯ} is necessarily internal to the participial relative clause, since the main verb \forme{jɤ-ɣe} is intransitive, and only the transitive verb \forme{ɯ-kɯ-nɯmbrɤpɯ} in the relative clause can have triggered ergative marking.\footnote{In addition, example (\ref{ex:WkWnWmbrApW}) provides an interesting case of double determiner marking (§\ref{sec:head-internal.relative.determiners}). }

The English translation of this sentence is:`The house where [the king] had taken them, it was a house completely made of iron'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Non-permanent and non-specific location can be relativized with finite relative clauses, as in (\ref{ex:kurAZi.khu.Wsta}) and (\ref{ex:kha.jAwGtsWmnW}). Thus, the finite relative \forme{ku-rɤʑi nɯ} in (\ref{ex:kurAZi.khu.Wsta}) can be translated as `the place where he happens to be' while `the place where he stays (permanently), his staying place' is better expressed with an oblique participle \forme{ɯ-(sɤ)z-rɤʑi} (§\ref{sec:locative.participle.relatives}).
A: word: kʰa	 gloss: house

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Instrumental participial relative clauses can take the generic inalienably possessed noun \japhug{the morpheme ___}{material} as overt head, to disambiguate with other types of relatives, in particular locative ones, built with an oblique participle (§\ref{sec:oblique.participle}). For instance, in (\ref{ex:tusANke.Wspa}), the focus is on the use of the path (a path specially made in order to be able to walk inside the field), rather than simply on the location (`the place where one walks').

Given the meaning of this example, it could appear to be preferrable to analyze these examples as complement clauses, translating \forme{<yazi> tɤ-kɤ-mɯrkɯ, tɤ-kɤ-ndza} as `(he told him) that he had stolen and eaten a duck' and \forme{ɯ-βri ...nɯ-kɯ-ɬoʁ} as `that his body started itching, and that feathers started growing on it'.

Question 152:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He told [the old man] everything that had happened, about the duck that he had stolen and eaten, and his body itching, and the duck feathers that had grown on it.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: However, the problem with analyzing these clauses as infinitival complement clauses is that the intransitive motion verb \japhug{ɬoʁ}{come out}, being dynamic, never takes a \forme{kɤ-} infinitive, and that the form \forme{nɯ-kɯ-ɬoʁ} can only be a subject participle `(something) that has come out'. For this reason, the non-finite clauses in (\ref{ex:yazi.tAkAmWrkW}) have to be analyzed as head-internal and headless (object and subject) participial relative clauses.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I cannot imitate a child crying, but apart from that I can imitate [anything].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Second, these verbs can occur with a participial clause whose subject is overt and different from the subject of the verb of the matrix clause, as in (\ref{ex:tApAtso.kWGAwu.kAnWCpWz}) where \japhug{the morpheme ___}{child} is the subject of the verb \japhug{ɣɤwu}{cry} in the participial clause, but not the subject of \japhug{nɯɕpɯz}{pretend}, `disguise as', `imitate' (§\ref{sec:constr.participial.clause}). Such a subject mismatch would be completely ungrammatical with a purposive clause.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Third, we find examples like (\ref{ex:Wmi.kWmNAm.tonWCpWznW}) where the subject of the verb in the main clause is not coreferent with the subject of the participial clause but with the possessor of the subject. These cases can be accounted for as possessor relative clauses (§\ref{sec:subject.participle.other.relative}, §\ref{sec:S.possessor.relativization}): (\ref{ex:Wmi.kWmNAm.tonWCpWznW}) could thus be literally translated as `he pretended to be someone whose leg hurt'.
