It is only in these instances where the locative is used in movement contexts that the locative may be inflected for imperative mood (§\ref{sec:imp}).

Sentence (with missing item): ma bakul kon ___ melelu
Gloss (with missing item): 3SG basket one ___ sit
The English translation of this sentence is:`He sits on the rim of a basket.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Locatives may occur with verbs, although no verb requires a locative complement. Some verbs, like ecie `to return' and bo `to go', must precede a locative (\ref{exe:Vloc}), and occur in constructions where movement towards a goal is expressed, rather than location. It is only in these instances where the locative is used in movement contexts that the locative may be inflected for imperative mood (§\ref{sec:imp}). Other verbs, like melelu `to sit', follow the locative (\ref{exe:locV}). The behaviour of different verbs with locatives is further described in §\ref{sec:svcloclat}.
A: word: bol-un=ko	 gloss: mouth-3POSS=LOC

Sentence (with missing item): an ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`I was in Wagom.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are two ways to mark NPs with locative =ko \parencite[cf.][]{huber2018}. When there is no ambiguity with regard to the location of the referent, or when the location is big or generic, =ko can be attached to a NP consisting of just a noun. This applies to place names\is{names!place names} (see \ref{exe:locpred}), landscape features such as kolak `forest; mountain; mainland' or pasier `sea' (see \ref{exe:kolaonin}) and kewe `house' (see \ref{exe:Vloc}). With smaller and more specific nouns, like bakul `basket' (see \ref{exe:locV}) or kaden `body' (see \ref{exe:pepkaden}), the exact location has to be specified with the help of a relational noun. These nouns are commonly inflected with possessive suffix -un and and then followed by locative =ko (see Table~\ref{tab:locationals} in §\ref{sec:inal}). These roots cannot stand alone as a subject, object or location, but must be inflected with possessive -un, locative =ko, both -un and =ko, -pis `side', or -kadok `side'. Alternatively, they may be followed by a local demonstrative, as in~(\ref{exe:elak}).
