Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Given, however, the restrictions on the distribution of \phono{-RU-sHa} --~it inflects only for third person\footnote{The corpus counts 330 instances of \phono{-RU} (\phono{-\uo/-chi/-mu}) \phono{-sHa}; in only two cases is it not inflected for third person.} and it is not contentful either with stative verbs or with the copulative, \phono{ka-}~-- it is improbable that it that would constitute the language’s principal strategy for rendering the past perfect. Rather, to indicate the sequence of two completed events, speakers of \SYQ{} generally employ ether the subordinator \phono{-pti}~(\ref{Glo4:nqa}), (\ref{Glo4:Hinaptinshiis}) or a connective like \phono{hinashpa} or \phono{hinaptin}~(\ref{Glo4:Suyarusa}).\footnote{It has been suggested to me that an additional function of \phono{-sHa} might be to indicate ‘sudden discovery’ \citep{Adelaar77}\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.} or surprise. That is, \phono{-sHa} might indicate the mirative, as do the perfect marker \phono{-shka} in Ecuadorian Q \citep{muysken1977syntactic} and ‘non-experienced’ past tense marker \phono{-sqa} in \ili{Cuzco} Q \citep{Faller03}\index[aut]{Faller, Martina} \citep[as cited in][223--33]{Peterson14}.\index[aut]{Peterson, Tyler} This is a hypothesis I am currently investigating.}
