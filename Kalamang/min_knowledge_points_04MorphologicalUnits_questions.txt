The English translation of this sentence is:`I paddled and paddled again, fished at the reef edge, fished and fished, the fish didn't bite.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Kalamang also makes use of repetition\is{repetition}. Repetition is distinguished from reduplication by two diagnostics: repetition applies to the domain of the word (such that each repeated word carries its own stress) and repetition may have two or more copies (whereas reduplication involves two copies only). Repetition is different from tail-head linking (§\ref{sec:tailhead}) in that it occurs within the clause. As an example, consider the repetition of the morpheme ___ `to its gloss ___' (repeated three times, each repetition carrying a main stress) and war `to fish' in~(\ref{exe:wariw}) (repeated twice and with predicate linker =i). Reduplication is predominantly attested with verbs to indicate iteration or duration. %cite gil 2005?
