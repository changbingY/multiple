Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): mana ___ li-u
Gloss (with missing item): spear ___ down-put
The English translation of this sentence is:`The spear fell.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{subject marker} can occur with either \isi{animate} or \isi{inanimate} referents, as seen in examples \REF{ex:det:2} through \REF{ex:det:7}. In these examples, each NP marked by a \isi{subject marker} is translated with the \ili{English} definite article ‘the’. This reflects the fact that subject markers (as determiners) may function to signal \isi{definiteness} (or \isi{specificity}) in a referent. That said, it is often possible to translate NPs with subject markers with the \ili{English} \isi{indefinite} article ‘a, an’ or with no article at all. Indeed, the \isi{semantic} range and discourse functions of these articles remain largely unknown to me.

The \isi{subject marker} is all the more valuable in this regard when one or more of the members of the conjoined subject is left unexpressed. In example \REF{ex:det:17}, the \isi{dual} marker indicates that there are two subjects, even though only one is expressed.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Thus, in addition to serving as an indicator of \isi{number}, the \isi{subject marker} can function as an \isi{associative plural} marker (or \isi{associative dual} marker) -- that is, when following a noun, a \isi{subject marker} can be used to give the interpretation of “that noun plus others associated with it”. In this way, the \isi{dual} \isi{subject marker} indexes that exactly one associated referent is to be understood, whereas the \isi{plural} \isi{subject marker} indexes that two or more additional referents are to be understood. This \isi{associative plural} function of subject markers (or \isi{object marker}s) is most commonly used with \isi{personal noun}s. An example with a \isi{plural} \isi{subject marker} is given in \REF{ex:det:18}.

Gloss (with missing item): father 3SG.SUBJ hole ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Father dug two holes.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although it may be possible to explain the \isi{allomorph} [mo=] (for ma= ‘3\textsc{sg.obj’)} in terms of simple \isi{phonological} conditioning (that is, without considering \isi{morphology}, \sectref{sec:2.5.7}), the form mini= ‘3\textsc{du.obj’} is clearly a \isi{morphological}ly conditioned change, since, elsewhere, consecutive \isi{consonant}s are simply \isi{degeminate}d. Thus, one should expect the \isi{allomorph}, were it \isi{phonological}ly conditioned, to be \textsuperscript{†}[mi=]. Indeed, the form mini= ‘3\textsc{du.obj’} only appears before verbs, not even before \isi{postposition}s, suggesting that \isi{object-marker} \isi{clitic}s for verbs are somewhat more closely affiliated with their hosts than are \isi{object-marker} \isi{clitic}s for \isi{postposition}s.} The \isi{allomorph} mini= ‘3\textsc{du.obj’} can thus be observed when the morpheme immediately precedes an initial /n/ of a \isi{verb stem} \REF{ex:det:43}, but not when it precedes other \isi{consonant}s (e.g., /l/) \REF{ex:det:44}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The uncles will make a pick-axe and give it to her.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although helpful in designating the \isi{number} of referents in an object NP, object markers, like \isi{subject marker}s (\sectref{sec:7.1}), are not always included in their respective NPs. Again, their absence may be a simple omission, the product of casual speech. Their omission does, however, seem to be more likely when the referent is less definite, but no clear correlation has been found in the corpus. In other words, Ulwa may exhibit a form of \is{object marking} \isi{differential object marking} in addition to exhibiting \isi{differential subject marking} (\sectref{sec:7.1}). The objects of examples \REF{ex:det:48} and \REF{ex:det:49} are both \isi{indefinite}; in \REF{ex:det:48} the object receives the \isi{object marker} (for each of two verbs), whereas in \REF{ex:det:49} it does not.

Sentence (with missing item): ala nï nji ___
Gloss (with missing item): PL.DIST 1SG thing ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Guys, I killed something!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to the three object markers used for indexing what are usually definite referents (whether \isi{singular}, \isi{dual}, or \isi{plural}), there is a (third-\isi{singular}) \isi{indefinite} marker, ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’, clearly derived from the \isi{numeral} kwa {\textasciitilde} kwe ‘one’. I consider this form to be a sort of \isi{object marker}, both because it tends to \isi{clitic}ize to the following verb, \isi{postposition}, or \isi{oblique marker} and because it never appears in subject NPs: only the forms /kwa/ or /kwe/ may appear in this position (and when they do they have definite reference, i.e., ‘one’). Given that it is not found with nouns in subject NPs, but is rather thus restricted in use, the \isi{indefinite} marker ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’ is not considered to be an “\isi{indefinite} article”.\footnote{Note, however, that the form [ko] can occur as a free morpheme. When it does, it is to be interpreted as the \isi{modal adverb} ko ‘just’, not as the \isi{indefinite} \isi{object marker} ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’, with which it is probably etymologically related. Perhaps another reason for not considering ko= ‘\textsc{indf}’ to be an article is that it is never obligatory.} The \isi{indefinite} \isi{object marker} is illustrated by examples \REF{ex:det:59} through \REF{ex:det:63}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the basic function of \isi{demonstrative} determiners is taken to be a means of providing spatial \isi{deixis} from the reference point of the speaker, the actual range of uses of demonstratives is much greater. First, it is not uncommon for a speaker to project a \isi{deictic center} to a point other than the self. Thus, while \isi{demonstrative} words in Ulwa are taken generally to be \isi{egocentric}, a speaker may choose a reference point other than himself or herself in the moment of \isi{speech}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`In the past, there was no cemetery here.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Demonstratives, although fundamentally spatial, may be extended in their use to have \isi{temporal} \isi{deixis}. Thus, \isi{proximal} forms may be used to refer to \isi{time}s (\isi{metaphor}ically) close to the \isi{present}, whereas \isi{distal} forms signal more (\isi{metaphor}ically) distant \isi{time}, as illustrated by examples \REF{ex:det:102} through \REF{ex:det:106}.

Gloss (with missing item): moon ___ go 3SG.OBJ=be{-cond} house SG.DIST=build-IRR
The English translation of this sentence is:`Next month [I] will go and build a house there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example \REF{ex:det:106} also illustrates how words like \ili{English} ‘this’, ‘these’, ‘that’, and ‘those’ are often not ideal (or even possible) translations for the \isi{demonstrative} markers. This is because, even though the Ulwa \isi{demonstrative}s serve some \isi{deictic} function of pointing to a place or \isi{time}, they do not necessarily have a definite referent. Thus, in example \REF{ex:det:106}, the translation ‘a house’ is given, since this unbuilt house has no definite referent; the salient information, however, is that the house will be built ‘there’.\footnote{Of course, it is possible that the ‘house’ in this sentence does indeed have a definite referent, just not a real-world one, and that the speaker and hearer can both be thinking of a specific yet-to-be-built house.}

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to spatial and \isi{temporal} \isi{deictic} functions, the \isi{demonstrative} words in Ulwa can serve discourse functions as well, pointing to \isi{speech} itself, whether already spoken or not yet uttered \REF{ex:det:107}.

That said, there does seem to be a tendency for \isi{object marker}s to be omitted from NPs containing (or consisting exclusively of) the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’. Perhaps this suggests that the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ behaves differently from other modifiers. Alternatively it may simply support the idea that there is a correlation between lack of \isi{object marker}s and lack of \isi{definiteness} (\sectref{sec:7.2}).

However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Amiwa mï ___ lamndu ma=asa-p
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___ pig 3SG.OBJ=hit-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`Amiwa killed the fourth pig.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The notion of ‘third’ may be denoted by the \isi{dual} \isi{object marker} min= ‘\textsc{3du}’ \isi{clitic}izing to the verb angani ka- ‘follow’ \REF{ex:det:240}, whereas ordinal notions greater than ‘third’ would be suggested by the \isi{plural} \isi{object marker} ndï= ‘\textsc{3pl}’ \REF{ex:det:241}.
A: word: ndï=angani-ka-en	 gloss: 3PL=before-let-NMLZ
B: word: min=angani-ka-en	 gloss: 3DU=before-let-NMLZ
C: word: maka=p-e	 gloss: thus=be{-dep}
D: word: ndï=n	 gloss: 3PL=OBL
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Question 234:
You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Amiwa mï ___ lamndu ma=asa-p
Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___ pig 3SG.OBJ=hit-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`Amiwa killed the fourth pig.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:det:241}, ndanganiken ‘the one following them’ could refer to any ordinal number fourth or greater (or third or greater, if \isi{plural} marking may be allowed for \isi{dual} referents, \sectref{sec:9.1.2}). Thus, there is no straightforward means of distinguishing \is{ordinal numeral} ordinals in Ulwa beyond first-second-third.
A: word: ndï=angani-ka-en	 gloss: 3PL=before-let-NMLZ
B: word: min=angani-ka-en	 gloss: 3DU=before-let-NMLZ
C: word: mbunmana	 gloss: black
D: word: angani-ka-en	 gloss: behind-let-NMLZ
Please only return the letter (A–D).
