The example contains the complex \isi{noun phrase} the morpheme ___ karma kabe, in which the \isi{indefinite} the morpheme ___ `some, another' and kar=ma `from the village' are both candidates for the \textsc{determiner} slot. However, the \isi{indefinite} does not refer to kabe `man', but to kar `village'. In other words, the \isi{indefinite} fills the \textsc{determiner} slot of the embedded \isi{noun phrase}, and the embedded \isi{noun phrase} fills the \textsc{determiner} slot of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. This is shown with square brackets in the example. Note that (\ref{ex515}) shows the same structure.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: These different fillers cannot co-occur. Consider example (\ref{ex518}), which is taken from a nzürna trikasi, a local equivalent to European witch stories. The example contains the complex \isi{noun phrase} nä karma the morpheme ___, in which the \isi{indefinite} nä `some, another' and kar=ma `from the village' are both candidates for the \textsc{determiner} slot. However, the \isi{indefinite} does not refer to the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___', but to kar `village'. In other words, the \isi{indefinite} fills the \textsc{determiner} slot of the embedded \isi{noun phrase}, and the embedded \isi{noun phrase} fills the \textsc{determiner} slot of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`She really did many other things ... but she did this in public.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{determiner} can appear in postposed position, which I analyse as non-prototypical order. The rest of this section describes this postposed position of the \isi{determiner}. Example (\ref{ex524}) is taken from the same story as the previous example. The \isi{noun phrase} the morpheme ___ yam nä `many other things' contains the \isi{quantifier} the morpheme ___ in the \textsc{premodifier} slot, the noun yam `event' in the \textsc{head} slot, and the \isi{indefinite} nä in postposed position. This \isi{noun phrase} can be arranged in different orders, for example: nä the morpheme ___ yam, nä yam the morpheme ___. However, the \textsc{determiner} and \textsc{premodifier} slots cannot be exchanged. This order of elements, for example the morpheme ___ nä yam, would be split into two co-referential \isi{noun phrase}s, which is signalled by a break in the intonation contour and case marking on both \isi{noun phrase}s. Case markers would attach to the morpheme ___ as well as nä yam.
A: word: tüfr	 gloss: plenty

The English translation of this sentence is:`It was a man from another village who she ate ... from Mogarkam.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We saw in (\ref{ex518}) that the \isi{determiner} belongs to the \isi{head} of the embedded \isi{noun phrase} and not to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. In such cases, the embedded \isi{noun phrase} `blocks' the \textsc{determiner} slot, and postposing a \isi{determiner} is the only option for it to refer to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. This is shown in (\ref{ex519}), where the postposed \isi{indefinite} the morpheme ___ refers to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. The embedded \isi{noun phrase} safsma is marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} in adnominal function. It specifies the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}: safsma kabe `man from Safs'. Note that the same could be expressed by a \isi{nominal} compound safs kabe `Safs man'. The semantic difference between an embedded \isi{noun phrase} marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} and a \isi{nominal} compound lies in the reference of the \isi{determiner}: ane safs kabe `that Safs man' versus ane safsma kabe `man from that Safs' (i.e. not from some other place called Safs). It follows that the two elements in (\ref{ex519}) restrict the reference of the \isi{head} simultaneously: the embedded \isi{noun phrase} safma and the postposed \isi{determiner} the morpheme ___. A postposed \isi{determiner} usually occurs only if the \isi{noun phrase} is not flagged with a \isi{case} marker. But there are exceptions to this. See (\ref{ex523}) discussed below.

The embedded \isi{noun phrase} safsma is marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} in adnominal function. It specifies the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}: safsma the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___ from Safs'. Note that the same could be expressed by a \isi{nominal} compound safs the morpheme ___ `Safs its gloss ___'. The seits gloss ___tic difference between an embedded \isi{noun phrase} marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} and a \isi{nominal} compound lies in the reference of the \isi{determiner}: ane safs the morpheme ___ `that Safs its gloss ___' versus ane safsma the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___ from that Safs' (i.e. not from some other place called Safs).

A postposed \isi{determiner} usually occurs only if the \isi{noun phrase} is not flagged with a \isi{case} marker. But there are exceptions to this. See (\ref{ex523}) discussed below.

Question 15:
You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): wati ___ ane fof ezi ŋatha thä\stem{s}a thgathg=en.
Gloss (with missing item): then ___ DEM EMPH morning dog STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:PFV/call burned.place=LOC.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Well, that Gwam called the dogs to the burned place in the morning.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We saw in (\ref{ex518}) that the \isi{determiner} belongs to the \isi{head} of the embedded \isi{noun phrase} and not to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. In such cases, the embedded \isi{noun phrase} `blocks' the \textsc{determiner} slot, and postposing a \isi{determiner} is the only option for it to refer to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. This is shown in (\ref{ex519}), where the postposed \isi{indefinite} nä refers to the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}. The embedded \isi{noun phrase} safsma is marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} in adnominal function. It specifies the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}: safsma kabe `man from Safs'. Note that the same could be expressed by a \isi{nominal} compound safs kabe `Safs man'. The semantic difference between an embedded \isi{noun phrase} marked with the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} and a \isi{nominal} compound lies in the reference of the \isi{determiner}: ane safs kabe `that Safs man' versus ane safsma kabe `man from that Safs' (i.e. not from some other place called Safs). It follows that the two elements in (\ref{ex519}) restrict the reference of the \isi{head} simultaneously: the embedded \isi{noun phrase} safma and the postposed \isi{determiner} nä. A postposed \isi{determiner} usually occurs only if the \isi{noun phrase} is not flagged with a \isi{case} marker. But there are exceptions to this. See (\ref{ex523}) discussed below.
A: word: gwam=f	 gloss: gwam=ERG.SG

Sentence (with missing item): ___ mayawa=ma kabe nä fä thägathizath.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ mayawa=CHAR man INDF DIST STPL:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:IPFV/leave.
The English translation of this sentence is:`They left some of our Mayawa people there.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although very rare, both \textsc{determiner} slots \textendash{} that of the embedded \isi{noun phrase} and that of the matrix \isi{noun phrase} \textendash{} can be filled. In (\ref{ex553}), the first \isi{non-singular} \isi{possessive} the morpheme ___ refers to mayawa, the \isi{head} of the embedded \isi{noun phrase}, and the \isi{indefinite} \isi{determiner} nä refers to kabe, the \isi{head} of the matrix \isi{noun phrase}.
A: word: nzenme	 gloss: FNSG.POSS

The English translation of this sentence is:`This is another fruit.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It follows from the discussion above that two determiners must belong to different \isi{noun phrase}s if they occur next to each other, like the morpheme ___ and nä in example (\ref{ex521}). In this example, I analyse the morpheme ___ as a \isi{noun phrase} with an omitted \isi{head}.

Sentence (with missing item): no=f ___ nima thä\stem{kothm}ako.
Gloss (with missing item): water=ERG ___ like.this SG:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:PFV:ANDAT/chase.
The English translation of this sentence is:`The flood chased away others like this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The elements in the \textsc{determiner} slot cannot be inflected for the full range of cases. For example, demonstratives cannot be inflected for \isi{ergative}, dative, \isi{possessive} and the three spatial cases. In (\ref{ex522}), the \isi{indefinite} the morpheme ___ is interpreted as referring to the \isi{object} argument, rather than the \isi{ergative} marked argument.
A: word: nä	 gloss: INDF

Gloss (with missing item): then ___ DEM EMPH morning dog STSG:SBJ>TSG.MASC:OBJ:PST:PFV/call burned.place=LOC.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Well, that Gwam called the dogs to the burned place in the morning.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: However, elicitation has shown that even this is possible, but such a structure is very rare. A textual example is shown in (\ref{ex523}), where ane refers to the preceding noun, which is flagged with an \isi{ergative}. Note that in this example, ane is followed by the \isi{emphatic} \isi{particle} fof, which has always scope over the preceding phrase ({\S}\ref{discourse-particles}). Thus, fof may `help' to mark the right edge of the \isi{noun phrase} gwamf ane. This is, however, not the main function of fof.
A: word: gwam=f	 gloss: gwam=ERG.SG

The English translation of this sentence is:`But, as for the other big dogs, they were barking there in Büdisn at the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Syntactic evidence for the possibility of postposing the \isi{determiner} comes from fronted relative clauses which are commonly used for topicalisation ({\S}\ref{info-cleft}). Fronted relative clauses of this type have the following structure: NP mane \textsc{copula}. They only allow a full \isi{noun phrase} before the relative \isi{pronoun} mane `which, who'. In (\ref{ex528}), the \isi{noun phrase} includes the postposed \isi{indefinite} \isi{determiner} nä following its \isi{head} ŋatha `dog'. The fronted \isi{relative clause} is marked by square brackets.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Only they (were) there. That big girl was disturbing them.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The elements in the \textsc{modifier} slots are different from those in the \textsc{determiner} slot. They can all be inflected for \isi{case} if they happen to occur as the last element of the \isi{noun phrase}. This is shown in (\ref{ex525}) and (\ref{ex526}). In example (\ref{ex525}), the \isi{modifier} is an \isi{adjective} in the \textsc{premodifier} slot. In example (\ref{ex526}), the adjective follows the \isi{head} in the \textsc{postmodifier} slot, and consequently the \isi{adjective} receives the \isi{case} marker.
A: word: ane	 gloss: DEM

Gloss (with missing item): then ... ___ deceased=ERG.SG ... wäni=ERG.SG SG:SBJ:IRR:PFV:ANDAT/hear.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, his late father, Wäni, heard (about it).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are some restrictions for specific elements, for example the locationals can only inflect for spatial cases. Furthermore, all locationals ({\S}\ref{locationals-sec}) and a few adjectives ({\S}\ref{adjectives-sec}) only occur in the \textsc{postmodifier} slot, not in the \textsc{premodifier} slot. One such adjective is kwark `late, deceased' in (\ref{ex527}). It occurs in the \textsc{postmodifier} slot, and therefore it is flagged with the \isi{ergative} \isi{case}. Note that the proper name Wäni is also inflected with the \isi{ergative} and forms a \isi{noun phrase} co-referential to nafaŋafe kwark `his late father'.
A: word: nafa-ŋafe	 gloss: Third.POSS-father

Gloss (with missing item): then ... ___ deceased=ERG.SG ... wäni=ERG.SG SG:SBJ:IRR:PFV:ANDAT/hear.
The English translation of this sentence is:`Then, his late father, Wäni, heard (about it).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The lack of textual examples which display all possible fillers at once is best explained by a strong tendency to distribute information over several co-referential \isi{noun phrase}s, either in the same clause or over a series of clauses. This can be seen in examples like (\ref{ex527}), (\ref{ex528}) or (\ref{ex529}). I will address this topic in the following section.
A: word: nafa-ŋafe	 gloss: Third.POSS-father

Gloss (with missing item): ___ two=EMPH REDUP-small ... fosam daisy Third.ABS STDU:SBJ:PST:PFV/do worm STDU:SBJ>STPL:OBJ:PST:IPFV/dig.
The English translation of this sentence is:`These two small (ones), Fosam and Daisy, they did that. They dug the worms.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{head} of a \isi{noun phrase} is often omitted. Consider example (\ref{ex535}), where a mother tells me that she had sent two small children to dig for worms. The example starts out with the \isi{noun phrase} the morpheme ___ edawä kakatan `these two small (ones)'. Ellipsis of the \isi{head} only occurs when the \isi{head} is recoverable from previous context, or if it is common ground between speaker and hearer.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They started hanging the fishing lines ... some on this side and some on the other side.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex536}) shows the \isi{indefinite} \isi{demonstrative} the morpheme ___ used twice without a \isi{head}. This is possible because the appropriate filler for the \textsc{head} slot zuzi `fishing line' was already mentioned.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Its child ... well, when the fish tries to return, the small (one) will bring it back here ... it will not get out.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex537}) is a description of a fish trap. These long bamboo baskets always consist of a larger basket and a smaller basket which is placed inside the bigger one. In the example, the speaker refers to the smaller basket as nafane nge `its child' and later only with an adjective katan `small' which is flagged with an \isi{ergative} \isi{case} marker.

You are a linguist specializing in Komnzo. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ane ___ kar emoth thwa\stem{nor}m.
Gloss (with missing item): DEM ___ place girl STPL:SBJ:PST:DUR/shout.
The English translation of this sentence is:`These bush girls were shouting.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Compounds can be embedded within one another, which can lead to combinations of usually up to three elements. A rare example of a compound with four elements was coined by one of my informants to describe the botanist on our team: wämne taga yf kabe (lit. `tree leaf name man'). Embedded compounds are always left-branching, and thus we can represent long compounds in this way: [[[wämne taga]\textsubscript{3} yf]\textsubscript{2} kabe]\textsubscript{1}. Two corpus examples of longer compounds are given in (\ref{ex510}) and (\ref{ex511}).
A: word: ksi	 gloss: bush
B: word: t-trika-si	 gloss: REDUP-tell-NMLZ
C: word: ane	 gloss: DEM

Sentence (with missing item): ane ___ kar emoth thwa\stem{nor}m.
Gloss (with missing item): DEM ___ place girl STPL:SBJ:PST:DUR/shout.
The English translation of this sentence is:`These bush girls were shouting.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Complex heads are different from complex \isi{noun phrase}s, that is, compounds in the \textsc{head} slot are distinct from embedded \isi{noun phrase}s. The latter must be marked with adnominal \isi{case}. Let us take the compound from example (\ref{ex510}): ane the morpheme ___ kar emoth `those its gloss ___ girls' (lit. `its gloss ___ place girls'). We can embed the \isi{noun phrase} the morpheme ___ kar `its gloss ___ place' into the matrix \isi{noun phrase} by adding the \isi{characteristic} \isi{case} (=ma): the morpheme ___ karma emoth `girls from the its gloss ___'. In addition to \isi{case} marking, the reference of the \isi{demonstrative} ane in initial position depends on whether a \isi{noun phrase} is embedded or the \isi{head} contains a compound. In the former \isi{case}, ane refers to the \isi{head} of the embedded \isi{noun phrase}: ane the morpheme ___ karma emoth `girls from that its gloss ___ place'. If the \isi{head} slot contains a compound, and no embedding takes place, the \isi{demonstrative} refers to the compound, as in (\ref{ex510}). The reference of the \textsc{determiner} slot is described above in {\S}\ref{npsyntaxdeterminer}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`There were only five pigs like these ... raised pigs.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In noun-headed compounds, the argument role of the noun with respect to the verb is less determined than in verb-headed compounds. The following argument roles are found: actor (zan kabe `killer'), \isi{patient} (mgthksi ruga `feeding pig' in (\ref{ex539}) above), instrument (bi näbüsi wämne `sago beating stick'), location (yonasi faf `drinking place'), or time (tharisi efoth `harvesting time'). This variability contrasts with verb-headed compounds, where the noun is always a \isi{patient} or \isi{theme}, as in kabe zan `war' (lit. `people hitting'), ruga mgthksi `pig feeding' in (\ref{ex540}) above, or wawa yarisi `yam exchange' (lit. `yam giving'). Note that there is an implied \isi{agent} in most of these examples. It follows that (nominalised) \isi{intransitive} verbs do not participate in verb-headed compounds. For example, there can be a mthizsi kabe `resting person' or a yathizsi kabe `dying person'. But the reverse order is ungrammatical: \textsuperscript{\ast}kabe mthizsi or \textsuperscript{\ast}kabe yathizsi.
