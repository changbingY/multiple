However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ma cika vuki-n ma a=xaahni ___ ma a=vwa tââ-n

The English translation of this sentence is:So that there was no reason for her to seek something to make her oven (with) (i.e. cook).
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: %Maybe example \ref{ex:ca_oven} is different from example \ref{ex:ca_field}, and more akin to \ref{ex:ca_xhuam}. In \ref{ex:ca_oven} and \ref{ex:ca_xhuam}, ca refers to parts of uncountable \qu{masses} (food in one case, things to put in her oven in the other). It is probably related to ca(-n) \qu{in (it)} (see \ref{ex:t2}). In \ref{ex:ca_field}, ca refers to a place, but more importantly, it does not modify a noun. The clause in brackets is subordinate to hân fwadai \qu{go look for it} and la \qu{be here} is anaphoric, but does it refer to ca, or something implied? ca is a preposition for nouns with an article.

The English translation of this sentence is:So that there was no reason for her to seek something to make her oven (with) (i.e. cook).
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cabeen, probably from ca been \qu{some others, some of them}, see (\ref{ex:ca_been}), is for 25-year-old Jean-Philippe Oué the unambiguous plural form of eca, whereas ca is a free variant of eca, but can also be used for the plural. A similar confusion is found in the examples below, which stem from the translated legend (the translators were all around 40–50 years old).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Demonstrative pronouns have nominal status in the sense that they function syntactically as nouns including case marking, except that they cannot take articles. Vamale demonstratives distinguish proximal and distal (see \Cref{tab:demonstratives}), making the system somewhat simpler than the regional three-way average \parencite[38]{lynch_oceanic_2002}. They are a closed class of six forms, whose members are only partially transparent. All forms contain a distal or proximal suffix, and the dual forms still carry as a stem the dual article mu. The plural forms' stem ni is identical to the plural article in Usa Vamale and other Voh-Koné varieties \parencite[42]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006} discussed in \sectref{ssec:ni}, and is accepted by most speakers of Vamale as well. The segment e- in the singular forms may derive from the singular article i and the plural forms could be composed of plural article ni and the singular, already lexicalised form. Demonstrative pronouns can serve both as topic and comment, as in (\ref{ex:WCdem}).
A: word: ehni	 gloss: DEM.PROX

C: word: i=jaxhut	 gloss: DEF.SG=story

The English translation of this sentence is:Jacob, it's bad for him if it's like this. That's how it is, you see?
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The demonstrative pronoun the morpheme ___ is special, because it can be used as a presentative (``this is Liline"), and to mark the comment of an equatiothe morpheme ___l clause (\ref{ex:the morpheme ____topic1}, \ref{ex:the morpheme ____topic2}). Since hni does not exist (anymore), the morpheme ___ is neither proximal nor distal, and functions as a more neutral pronoun.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Vamale possesses a small class of adverbs. They occur at the end of a clause or phrase, are frequently fronted without a phrase (\ref{ex:Adv}), take neither articles nor any kind of possessive or inflectional morphology, and are, if at all, modified by the intensifiers described in \sectref{sec:WCIntensifiers}, juu \qu{real, really, very}. As they modify verb, noun, and prepositional phrases, and as they can be fronted alone, this analysis considers them to be adjuncts. Most members are transparently derived from nouns or prepositional phrases. See \sectref{sec:Adv} for examples of their interaction with verb and noun phrases. Example (\ref{ex:Adv}) features two cases of fronted adverbs, (\ref{ex:Adv2}) shows an adverb at the end of a verb phrase, and (\ref{ex:Adv3}) shows an adverb after noun phrase.\largerpage[-2]

Question 36:
You are a linguist specializing in Vamale. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): e=ha-mwa ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG=go-REP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:I went back yesterday.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Vamale possesses a small class of adverbs. They occur at the end of a clause or phrase, are frequently fronted without a phrase (\ref{ex:Adv}), take neither articles nor any kind of possessive or inflectional morphology, and are, if at all, modified by the intensifiers described in \sectref{sec:WCIntensifiers}, juu \qu{real, really, very}. As they modify verb, noun, and prepositional phrases, and as they can be fronted alone, this analysis considers them to be adjuncts. Most members are transparently derived from nouns or prepositional phrases. See \sectref{sec:Adv} for examples of their interaction with verb and noun phrases. Example (\ref{ex:Adv}) features two cases of fronted adverbs, (\ref{ex:Adv2}) shows an adverb at the end of a verb phrase, and (\ref{ex:Adv3}) shows an adverb after noun phrase.\largerpage[-2]

The English translation of this sentence is:And there's the sap that rises, swells, the swells there. It dries then, gets hard then.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This class only has one member. Mwa has rather different, related meanings, depending on the context. Mwa can have the repetitive meaning \qu{again} (\ref{ex:the morpheme ____even}), the restitutive \qu{back}, as well as \qu{also}, \qu{even}, \qu{on top of that}, or mark the preceding phrase as focused (see \sectref{sec:the morpheme ___} for a discussion). The deictic use of the morpheme ___ \qu{now} (\ref{ex:the morpheme ___}), seems to mostly anchor the listener's attention, similarly to the morpheme ___ \qu{even}, onto the noun phrase given, see (\ref{ex:the morpheme ____now1a}). Mwa is a particle that can dock onto any phrase preceding it (see \ref{ex:the morpheme ____rep}).
