However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ mɛ kɔ̀bɛ-H ndáà tsì mɛ̀ɛ́ lémbo-lɛ
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1SG.PST1 break-R also emptyset7.interdiction 1SG.PRS.NEG know-NEG
The English translation of this sentence is:`[You were telling me to do so.] Or I also broke the interdiction, I don't know.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Disjunction, also called ``alternative coits gloss ___dination'', can be expressed with one of the coits gloss ___dinatits gloss ___s {\itshape kânà} and {\itshape nânà} `its gloss ___'. Disjunction is rather rare in the cits gloss ___pus, where only the variant {\itshape kânà} appears, but speakers state that it can always be replaced with {\itshape nânà}. Just like the conjunction coits gloss ___dinatits gloss ___ {\itshape nà}, {\itshape kânà}/{\itshape nânà} can appear in between clauses and sentence initially, as in \REF{its gloss ___}. Here, Nzambi explains that his friend told him to kill people in its gloss ___der to help them get white skin. He then concludes in a new sentence `Or I also broke the interdiction', as an alternative judgement of his deeds.

In contrast to conjunction, in disjunction, there seems to be a general preference to express the (same) subject overtly in both coits gloss ___dinands. Thus, {\itshape wɛ́} `you' is repeated also in the second clause.
A: word: nânà/kânà	 gloss: or

The English translation of this sentence is:`Give me only your child that you have here.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Gyeli does not have a distinct marker of relative clauses such as, for instance, relative pronouns. Instead, an attributive marker ({\ATT}) can be used to indicate the embedding relation between subordinate clause and modified noun phrase. This attributive marker, which agrees in gender with the head noun, is also used in noun + noun constructions, as discussed in \sectref{sec:ATT}. In most cases, however, the use of the attributive marker is optional so that a relative clause is often not marked by a dedicated morpheme. The circumstances under which speakers omit the attributive marker in contrast to using it are not clear. In the corpus, about half of the relative clauses appear with an attributive marker, as in \REF{REL4b}, and about half without, as in \REF{REL5}. Few generalizations can be made at this point as to what conditions the marker's appearance or omission. Both appearance and omission occur with attributive markers of all agreement classes, singular and plural. Further, attributive markers and their omission are found with all subject, object, and oblique noun phrases that are modified. Finally, the role that the head noun plays in the relative clause does not seem to be decisive for the appearance or omission of the attributive marker, since examples of both variants are found for cases where the head of the relative clause is the subject or any type of object of the relative clause, as I will show below. The only criterion that seems to favor attributive marker deletion is when the attributive marker and the following \textsc{stamp} marker are identical in shape, as for instance in \REF{SREL1}.
A: word: wà	 gloss: db1:ATT

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: All relative clauses are marked prosodically in that they are treated as distinct intonation units. As such, verb-final relative clauses its gloss ___ not take a realis-marking H tone in the realis moods as they would within an intonation phrase. In \REF{SREL1x}, the verb {\itshape the morpheme ___} `its gloss ___' surfaces with the underlying verb tone and its gloss ___es not take the realis-marking H tone that it would take if the verb was not at the boundary of an intonation phrase.

The English translation of this sentence is:`I cook so that you eat.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purpose clauses are dependent clauses that are introduced by the complementizer {\itshape nâ} and generally express purpose or intention, as illustrated in \REF{purpna1}. Unlike complement clauses, however, the dependent clause does not function as an argument of the main clause. Another difference to complement clauses is that the main clause is treated as an intonation phrase unit, while with complement clauses, the dependent clause is also part of that unit. This can be seen in the tonal behavior with respect to the realis-marking H tone. In \REF{purpna1}, the verb {\itshape the morpheme ___} `its gloss ___' in the main clause surfaces with a final L tone. In contrast, a complement clause would license the realis-marking H tone to surface, as shown in \REF{COMP1} above.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[Speak Gyeli!{\textemdash}] I say that there should be enough tin (roofed) houses here for me.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The structures both of the quotative index and of the quote differ from typical matrix and subordinate clauses. As for the {\QI}, the complementizer {\itshape the morpheme ___} belongs prosodically to the {\QI} and not to the quote, which is indicated by a pause after the complementizer.\footnote{This phenomenon has also been noted, for instance, in Hausa, as \citet[236]{guldemann2008} points out.} In some cases, the complementizer also undergoes salient lengthening, in addition to the following pause, as shown in \REF{RS1}.\footnote{In this example, the speaker has switched to Bulu and is reminded by the interpreter to speak in Gyeli. He then repeats what he has said by quoting his own speech. His quote is emphasized by the lengthened complementizer.} This does not happen in purpose clauses where {\itshape the morpheme ___} rather belongs to the dependent clause, also prosodically.\footnote{Concerning the relationship between complement clauses and instances of reported discourse, there might be a continuum, since also complement clauses with `say' or `think' verbs in the main clause may constitute examples of reported discourse as representations of spoken or mental text.}

Question 111:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ___ mɛ-H bwè-H nkwànò mɛ-H dè
Gloss (with missing item): ___ 1SG-PRS obtain-R emptyset3.honey 1SG-PRS eat
The English translation of this sentence is:`If I get honey, I eat [it].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Conditional clauses can usually express different degrees of realis or irrealis, making a statement about the likelihood whether the event in the main clause will really happen. In English, this is achieved by the use of different tenses. In Gyeli also, different tense-mood categories can be used in conditional clauses, as shown in \REF{ka6} through \REF{ka9}. Generally, the same tense-mood category is used in the conditional clause as is also used in the main clause. Thus, in \REF{ka6}, the main clause appears in the \textsc{present} and so does the conditional clause. When the \textsc{present} tense-mood category is used, the conditional has a high realis degree, i.e.\ the event of the main clause is very likely to happen. In such instances, where the reading is generic, {\itshape the morpheme ___} may also be replaced by {\itshape pílì} `when'.
A: word: ká	 gloss: dbif

The English translation of this sentence is:`If I obtain honey, I will eat [it].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The most salient strategy to mark a conditional clause as irrealis, however, is the use of the irrealis marker {\itshape kɔ̀}. In \REF{ka7}, for instance, the main and conditional clause appear in the \textsc{future}, which is inherently an irrealis category (\sectref{sec:GramTM}). The speaker can then choose to use the irrealis marker {\itshape kɔ̀} in order to express that it is rather unlikely that he will find honey. If {\itshape kɔ̀} is not used, the speaker indicates that it is more likely to find honey in the future.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same choice is given for conditionals in the \textsc{recent past}, as \REF{ka8} shows. Parentheses around {\itshape kɔ̀} indicate its optionality. Again, when the irrealis marker is used, it emphasizes the likelihood that the event of the main clause will not happen. In contrast to the \textsc{present} use in \REF{ka6}, the \textsc{recent past} seems to indicate a lower likelihood of finding honey.

The English translation of this sentence is:`He took the lighter, just lighting the house.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The sentential modifier in \REF{InfAdv3} can be omitted without making the sentence ungrammatical. It changes, however, the meaning of the sentence. Without it, the infinitival dependent clause would express purpose `He took the lighter in order to light the house.' The intended meaning with the sentential modifier is sequential: the person first takes the lighter and then sets the house on fire.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They don't produce [fruit] every year, these palm trees from which only unripe [fruit] fall.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A special case is presented in \REF{InfAdv4} where the infinitival clause has an overt subject. The verb {\itshape kwè} `fall' still appears in its infinitival form, lacking the realis-marking H tone. Since infinitival dependent clauses are very rare in the corpus, it is not possible at this point to establish what conditions the overt marking of subjects in this clause type.

Sentence (with missing item): a jì-H mbɛ̂ ___ gyíbɔ bwánɔ̀
Gloss (with missing item): 1.PST1 open-R ∅3.door ___ call ba2-child
The English translation of this sentence is:`She opened the door, just calling the children.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The sequential marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} seems to have exactly the same function as {\itshape vɛ̀ɛ̀} when introducing a dependent clause. While both sentential modifiers are compared in \sectref{sec:SentMod}, their potential distributional and semantic differences are even less clear as clause-introducing devices. It rather seems that they are freely interchangeable in this function. An example of {\itshape the morpheme ___} introducing an infinitival subordinate clause is given in \REF{InfAdv5}.
A: word: kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: SEQU
B: word: sâ/kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: only
C: word: béè	 gloss: 8.FUT
D: word: yíì	 gloss: COP

Question 133:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): a jì-H mbɛ̂ ___ gyíbɔ bwánɔ̀
Gloss (with missing item): 1.PST1 open-R ∅3.door ___ call ba2-child
The English translation of this sentence is:`She opened the door, just calling the children.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As with {\itshape vɛ̀ɛ̀}, omitting the sentential modifier in \REF{InfAdv5} gives a purpose reading of `She opens the door in order to call the children.' In contrast, {\itshape the morpheme ___} gives a sequential interpretation.
A: word: kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: SEQU
B: word: sâ/kɔ́ɔ̀	 gloss: only
C: word: béè	 gloss: 8.FUT
D: word: nà	 gloss: CONJ
Please only return the letter (A–D).

Question 134:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): a-H gyímbɔ a ___ sâ H-ma-kwásì
Gloss (with missing item): 1-PRS dance db1 ___ do OBJ.LINK-ma6-clapping
The English translation of this sentence is:`He dances while clapping.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Subordination can also be encoded by the subordinate form of the progressive marker, {\itshape the morpheme ___}, which, in main clauses, takes different forms (\sectref{sec:PROG}). In \REF{frame1}, the subordinate clause expresses simultaneity. Without the subordinate form of the aspect marker, the second clause would formally be identical to a main clause and could appear on its own.
A: word: nzɛ́ɛ́	 gloss: PROG.SUB
B: word: ɛ́ɛ́kɛ̀	 gloss: EXCL
C: word: kɛ̀	 gloss: go
D: word: w-ɔ̂	 gloss: 3-2SG.POSS
Please only return the letter (A–D).
