Ko{}-marked topicalisations refer to individuated entities (a single referent or a clearly defined group) which are accessible\is{Accessibility} to the hearer; in other words, the exact referent of the ko{}-marked subject has been introduced in the preceding context. By contrast, the he{}-marked subjects in the examples above are not accessible as individuated entities. Even though the hearer can infer their existence from the context, they have not been mentioned as such. In \REF{ex:8.93}, the context tells about a group of people – men, women and children – who go on an outing; prior to the sentence quoted here, the men have not been mentioned separately. Similarly, in \REF{ex:8.95}, the preceding sentences tell about the birth of two boys; the hearer can infer the existence of an oldest and a youngest boy, but it is only in the sentence quoted here that each boy is singled out. In both cases, the referent of the he{}-marked noun phrase is not accessible\is{Accessibility} as such, as it has only been introduced as undefined part of a larger group. By contrast, subjects topicalised\is{Topicalisation} with ko{}-marking are always accessible as individual referents; for example in \REF{ex:8.81} above, both mother and Tiare play a role in the preceding context.

Sentence (with missing item): He kī o ___ rū\ꞌau era...
Gloss (with missing item): NTR say of ___ old_woman DIST
The English translation of this sentence is:‘The old woman said...’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The use of possessives to express arguments in main clauses is largely speaker-depen\-dent: this construction is frequent in some texts, but absent in others. Though the precise conditions are not clear, possessive marking appears to be a device to demote\is{Subject!demotion} a non-salient\is{Salience} Agent. The fact that this is only found with the neutral marker he, which is also the nominal predicate marker, suggests that these clauses have been nominalised: \REF{ex:8.110} could tentatively be paraphrased as ‘(There was) the saying of that old woman...’. In that case, the verb is nominalised and he is the nominal predicate marker.\footnote{\label{fn:432}The directional atu in \REF{ex:8.111} may suggest that the phrase is still a verb phrase, but notice that atu occasionally occurs with nominalised verbs (\sectref{sec:3.2.3.3}).}
