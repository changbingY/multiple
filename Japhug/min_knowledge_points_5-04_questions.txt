Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In counterfactual constructions, the protasis describes a condition that is known to be false, and the apodosis indicates an outcome that would have occurred if the condition had been true. In Japhug, counterfactual conditionals have strict requirements on TAME marking in both the protasis and the apodosis. The verb in the protasis is in the Irrealis (§\ref{sec:irrealis.conditional}), and the Past Imperfective is required in the apodosis even for transitive dynamic verbs (§\ref{sec:pst.ifr.ipfv.apodosis}), as illustrated by (\ref{ex:GWtukWqura.apWNu.pWnApeta}) and (\ref{ex:apWtu.apWNua.pWra}).\footnote{In a previous publication (\citealt[301]{jacques14linking}), I claimed that there were counterfactual constructions with a verb in the Factual Non-Past in the apodosis (example 99), but this was an erroneous interpretation. }
