Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the subject is replaced by a free pronoun \REF{ex:3:2}, the pronoun must be marked as presupposed in the clause (see \sectref{sec:11.2}). Note that since the subject is pronominalised in the verb word a subject noun phrase is not required (see \sectref{sec:7.3.1}); the presence of any noun phrase or free pronoun is for pragmatic purposes.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another set of Moloko pronouns occurs only within noun phrases and among its primary uses, indicates a possessive relationship, i.e. these pronouns relate the possessor referent to the person or thing that is possessed. Possessive pronouns immediately follow the noun or noun phrase they modify (\ref{ex:3:9}--\ref{ex:3:11}) and occur before the plural clitic \REF{ex:3:12}.\footnote{\citet{Bow1997c} postulated that the set of possessive pronouns does not include the plural possessive pronouns. Rather, she proposed that the plural possessive is actually an associative noun phrase formed by the preposition /a/ and the free pronoun (a loko, a ləme, a ləkwəye, and a təta). We found that possessives are viewed as a set in the minds of speakers, and that there is no difference in distribution between singular and plural possessives. Therefore we will treat the possessive pronouns as a set in Moloko (aloko, aləme, aləkwəye, and atəta). }

The English translation of this sentence is:‘his wife’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: We consider the possessive pronouns to be noun clitics. They are phonologically bound to the noun. Even though prosodies on the possessive pronouns do not spread to the noun (\ref{ex:3:9}--\ref{ex:3:10}), \citet{Bow1997c} demonstrated that word-final changes indicating a word break do not occur (\tabref{tab:3.16}). They are clitics, not affixes, since they bind to the right edge of the head of the noun phrase, binding to the final noun where the head is composed of more than one noun, yet modifying the entire structure (\ref{ex:3:11}) (see \sectref{sec:5.4.2}).

You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ndɛ ___ na] ɬa=aŋgʷɔ=ahaj ɗaw
Gloss (with missing item): so ___ PSP cow=twoS.POSS=Pl {Q
The English translation of this sentence is:‘So, these [cows] here (in this place), are they your cows?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Nominal demonstratives (\ref{ex:3:46}--\ref{ex:3:48}) have a referent that is a person or object. They modify a noun within a noun phrase to specify or point out the referent. Moloko has two nominal demonstratives: proximal (near the speaker) and distal (away from the speaker). There is no nominal demonstrative to indicate a referent that is far away from the speaker. In the examples in this section, the demonstrative is bolded and the noun phrase is marked by square brackets. In \REF{ex:3:55} from \sectref{sec:3.2.2.1}, the demonstrative is head of the noun phrase, suggesting that it can act as a demonstrative pronoun.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘Later, they [gave] me this here paper.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sometimes local adverbial demonstratives\is{Focus and prominence!Local adverbial demonstratives|(} have a highlighting function for new information in a narrative, drawing attention to their referent.\footnote{\citet{Dixon2003} mentions that demonstratives can function to introduce new information. Note that in Moloko, all new information need not be marked with a demonstrative.} In the ‘Cows in the Field’ story (not illustrated in its entirety in this work), ɗerəywel nendəge ‘this paper here’ \REF{ex:3:60} was not with the speaker when he told the story; neither was it previously mentioned in the discourse. According to the discourse, the paper should have helped to bring justice to the men whose cotton was destroyed, but it didn’t. Its marking with a demonstrative therefore has the function to highlight the paper at that moment of the event line.

Example \REF{ex:3:63} is from the ‘Cows in the Field’ story (not illustrated in its entirety in this work). The narrative concerns dealings with the owners of a herd of cows that had destroyed someone’s field of cotton.
