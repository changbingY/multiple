Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Grammatical relations on noun phrases are encoded by postpositions such as the ergative \forme{the morpheme ___} (§\ref{sec:erg.kW}), the genitive \forme{ɣɯ} (§\ref{sec:genitive}) and the comitative \forme{cʰo} (§\ref{sec:comitative}), as well as relator nouns (§\ref{sec:relator.nouns}) such as the dative \forme{ɯ-ɕki} or \forme{ɯ-pʰe} (§\ref{sec:dative}). With the sole exception of the genitive forms of a few pronouns such as \forme{aʑɯɣ} \textsc{1sg}:\textsc{gen} (from \japhug{aʑo}{\textsc{1sg}} and \forme{ɣɯ}, §\ref{sec:pronouns.gen}), the postpositions do not merge phonologically with the previous word. As shown by (\ref{ex:Wpi.ni.kW}) and (\ref{ex:ra.GW.nWfsapaR}), they are located at the end of the noun phrase, further away from the head noun than all determiners, including number markers.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The first piece of evidence for this type of alignment in Gyalrong languages to have been proposed \citep{jackson03caodeng} is the fact that the \forme{kɯ-} (subject) participle (§\ref{sec:subject.participle.subject.relative}) is the only form that can be used to relativize both intransitive (§\ref{sec:intr.subject.relativization}) and transitive subjects (§\ref{sec:tr.subject.relativization}). However, the \forme{kɯ-} participles are not exclusively used to relativize intransitive and transitive subjects: they can also relativize possessors of intransitive subjects (§\ref{sec:possessor.relativization}), and are the only option to do so, resulting in ambiguities (see examples \ref{ex:WlaXtCha.pWkWtu} and \ref{ex:jla.nWRrW.kWtu} in §\ref{sec:possessive.mihi.est}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Example (\ref{ex:lWlu.nW.kW.tAkAndza}) illustrates a head-internal finite relative: the relativized object \japhug{the morpheme ___}{bird} is located between the transitive subject \forme{lɯlu nɯ kɯ} and the finite verb (an object participle \forme{tɤ-kɤ-ndza} (\textsc{aor}-\textsc{obj}:\textsc{pcp}-eat) would also be possible to express the same meaning), at the position it would normally occupy in the corresponding independent sentence (see \ref{ex:lWlu.nW.kW.tondza} above).
