Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Àdà nà Màmbì báà ___
Gloss (with missing item): ∅1.PN COM ∅1.PN 2.COP ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Ada and Mambi are teachers.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Unlike full nouns, nominalized past participles never allow a plural form. Thus, while the nominal predicate in \REF{NounPart2a} takes the plural noun class marker {\itshape ba}-, agreeing in number with the subject, this is not the case for the nominalized past participle in \REF{NounPart2b}.
A: word: ba-ngɛ̀lɛ́nɛ̀	 gloss: ba2-teacher
B: word: ngɛ̀lɛ́nɛ̀	 gloss: emptyset1.English
C: word: b-ùdì	 gloss: ba2-person

It is extra-clausal as evidenced by a phonetic break that separates {\itshape the morpheme ___} from the main clause and its ability to occur by itself, for instance as a response to an interlocutor's statement. A {\itshape the morpheme ___} response by itself expresses either surprise, a truth verification (`is that right?', `really?'), or agreement (`isn't that right!', `really!').

The English translation of this sentence is:`That (aforementioned) food, I have come to look for the food at your place.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The anaphoric marker {\itshape ndɛ̀} signals reference to an entity that has been mentioned before in the discourse. It occurs in two variants: (i) with an agreement prefix and (ii) as the stem only without an agreement prefix. The variant with agreement prefix is more frequent in the text corpus with almost six times more agreeing than free stem forms. A natural text example of {\itshape ndɛ́} with an agreement prefix is given in \REF{41t}.

Question 100:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): m-ùdì ___ nú-ndɛ̀ dígɛ-H m-ísì
Gloss (with missing item): N1-person ___ 1-ANA look-R ma6-eye
The English translation of this sentence is:`That (aforementioned) person thinks very hard [lit. looks with his eyes].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Another possibility would be to analyze the CV morph as an attributive marker. As shown in \sectref{sec:ATT}, many of the attributive markers across different agreement classes have a CV shape with a plain vowel and an H tone. Most attributive markers link a noun to a second constituent that could be another noun or another part of speech, such as an adjective or interrogative pronoun, as discussed in \sectref{sec:CONC}. Thus, this analysis would also make sense syntactically. Arguments against this explanation, however, concern the form of some attributive markers and their distribution. First, the attributive marker forms of agreement classes 1, 3, 7, and 9 differ from the CV shape element found with {\itshape ndɛ̀}. For instance, in agreement class 1, the attributive marker is {\itshape the morpheme ___}, while {\itshape ndɛ̀} would be preceded by {\itshape nú}-; in agreement class 7, the attributive marker is {\itshape yá}, but {\itshape ndɛ̀} is preceded by {\itshape yí}-. Second, there are examples where {\itshape ndɛ̀} plus its preceding CV morph follow a true attributive, as shown in \REF{ANAnoATT}. This makes it clear that the morph cannot be an attributive marker.

Sentence (with missing item): kàndá wɛ́ ___
Gloss (with missing item): ∅7.proverb ID ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`The story is this.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Unlike other nominal modifiers that always agree with their head noun, the anaphoric marker can also appear with its stem only. When following an identificational marker, {\itshape the morpheme ___} occurs without an agreement prefix, as shown in \REF{its gloss ___41t}, which was uttered at the end of a story.
A: word: ndɛ̀	 gloss: ANA

Gloss (with missing item): ECXL ∅1.chief ___ 1:ATT ∅1.PN
The English translation of this sentence is:`Ah, that chief from Nlunzo!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: \noindent The anaphoric marker {\itshape ndɛ́} also appears as a bare stem after nouns, as in \REF{its gloss ___42t}, which is a response to a question about the chief.

Gloss (with missing item): yes 1SG le5-name ___ emptyset1.PN
The English translation of this sentence is:`Yes, my name is Mama.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The similative marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} occurs both as a free morpheme and a prefix. The free morpheme {\itshape the morpheme ___} functions as a predicative marker that is restricted to naming constructions, linking the noun {\itshape jínɔ̀} `name' with a proper name, as shown in \REF{its gloss ___word}. It is distinct from other copula forms discussed in \sectref{sec:its gloss ___} and is labelled as a ``similative'' marker for its segmental identity with the similative prefix, which is more productive and more obviously denotes similarity (\sectref{sec:its gloss ___}).

B: word: náà	 gloss: by
C: word: tfúga	 gloss: suffer
D: word: bíwɔ̀	 gloss: bad

Sentence (with missing item): bà m-ínɔ̀ ___ Màmà nà Màmbì
Gloss (with missing item): 2 ma6-name ___ ∅1.PN CONJ ∅1.PN
The English translation of this sentence is:`Their names are Mama and Mambi.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The free similative marker is invariable, even if the noun + noun construction has plural constituents. As illustrated in \REF{its gloss ___word2}, number has to be identical in the first and second constituent, but the connecting similative marker {\itshape the morpheme ___} does not change.
A: word: ná	 gloss: SIM

Sentence (with missing item): mɛ ___ mɔ̀ bvùbvù
Gloss (with missing item): 1SG ___ COMPL lots
The English translation of this sentence is:`I have (already) grown lots.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I consider {\itshape mɔ̀} a free morpheme rather than a verbal suffix since tonal inflection of past tense and/or realis mood (\sectref{sec:SimpPred}) through the grammatical H tone happens on the preceding verb. If {\itshape mɔ̀} was a suffix, it would be the suffix (and the preceding toneless verbal derivation morphemes) that would take the grammatical H tone in non-final position. This, however, is not the case, as \REF{absmo1c} shows.
A: word: lùnga-h	 gloss: grow-R

The English translation of this sentence is:`I have (already) grown lots.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I consider {\itshape the morpheme ___} a free morpheme rather than a verbal suffix since tonal inflection of past tense and/or realis mood (\sectref{sec:SimpPred}) through the grammatical H tone happens on the preceding verb. If {\itshape the morpheme ___} was a suffix, it would be the suffix (and the preceding toneless verbal derivation morphemes) that would take the grammatical H tone in non-final position.

Sentence (with missing item): nà wɛ làdtɔ-H ___ nà ngã̀
Gloss (with missing item): Q 2SG.PST1 meet-R ___ COM emptyset1.healer
The English translation of this sentence is:`Have you ever/already met the healer?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There is no other element that can occur between the verb and the verbal particle. With verbs that require the comitative marker {\itshape nà} (\sectref{sec:MainVerbs}), for instance, {\itshape nà} follows the verbal particle, as in \REF{absmo7}.
A: word: mɔ̀	 gloss: COMPL

Sentence (with missing item): yá ___ nga bèkálàdè
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL-PRS ___ PL be8-book
The English translation of this sentence is:`Let's buy books!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: {\itshape ga/nga} always follows the finite verb, as can be seen in the contrast between the positive and the negated cohortative forms (\sectref{sec:NEGti}) in \REF{IMPga2}. In both cases, the verbal particle pluralizes the subject. In \REF{IMPga2a}, the finite verb is {\itshape the morpheme ___} `buy' in a simple predicate. In contrast, \REF{IMPga2b} shows a complex predicate where the finite verb is the negation auxiliary {\itshape tí}. The verbal plural particle follows the auxiliary, preceding the lexical verb.
A: word: gyàgâ	 gloss: buy.IMP

Sentence (with missing item): yá ___ nga bèkálàdè
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL-PRS ___ PL be8-book
The English translation of this sentence is:`Let's buy books!'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I consider {\itshape ga/nga} as a particle rather than a suffix that attaches to the finite verb of an \textsc{imperative} construction. If the particle was a suffix, one would expect it to take the HL tone that is characteristic of the \textsc{imperative} category. Instead, the particle is underlyingly toneless, behaving like toneless CV- noun class prefixes. Phrase finally, {\itshape ga/nga} surfaces as L, as shown in \REF{gaimp1} and \REF{ngaimp1}. If a nominal object follows, however, {\itshape nga} ``steals'' the object-linking H tone (\sectref{sec:HLinker}), which would otherwise surface on the noun class prefix in \REF{IMPga2a}. In that case, {\itshape be-kálàdè} surfaces with an L tone on the prefix.
