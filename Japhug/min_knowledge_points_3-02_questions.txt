Question 0:
You are a linguist specializing in Japhug. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): tɯ-zda pjɯ́-wɣ-z-ɣɤtɕa, ___ ntsɯ pjɯ-kɯ-ʑɣɤ-ɣɤŋgi tɕe, pɯ-kɯ-nɯ-ɣɤtɕa kɯ́nɤ pjɯ-kɯ-ʑɣɤ-ɣɤŋgi tɕe, ɯ-mbrɤzɯ kɯ-tu me tu-kɯ-ti ɲɯ-ŋu.

The English translation of this sentence is:`If one considers that one's companion is wrong, and always considers himself to be right even if one is wrong, there is can be no good result.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In Japhug, sentences have at most one generic human referent (§\ref{sec:indef.genr.poss}). If this referent is core argument, the verb has generic indexation (\forme{kɯ-} for intransitive subject and object and \forme{wɣ-} for transitive subject, as in the following example, §\ref{sec:indexation.generic.tr}). The generic argument can be realized as the generic pronoun \forme{the morpheme ___} as in (\ref{ex:pjWkWZGAGANgi}) or by a generic noun (such as \japhug{tɯrme}{person}, §\ref{sec:tWrme.generic}).
A: word: tɯʑo	 gloss: oneself
B: word: ɯʑora	 gloss: 3PL
C: word: stɯsti	 gloss: alone
D: word: kɯki	 gloss: DEM.PROX
Please only return the letter (A–D).

The English translation of this sentence is:`If one considers that one's companion is wrong, and always considers himself to be right even if one is wrong, there is can be no good result.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: As examples (\ref{ex:pjWkWZGAGANgi}) to (\ref{ex:tWZo.tWCki}) illustrate, generic agreement between pronoun, possessive prefix and verb indexation is very systematic. Examples of \textsc{1pl} indexation with generic pronouns or vice-versa are, however, attested (§\ref{sec:partitive.indexation}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`When they need to boil tea, to make a fire or smoke tobacco, people light up the fire with it.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The distal demonstratives \forme{nɯ} and \forme{the morpheme ___} serve as anaphoric pronouns with any type of referent, including humans, but also abstract concepts, inanimate objects or plants as in (\ref{ex:nWnW.kW.smi}), though as mentioned in §\ref{sec:pers.pronouns}, third person pronouns such as \japhug{ɯʑo}{he} can also have inanimate antecedents.

The English translation of this sentence is:`If it is not possible [to take the old man with us] we will not come, as we have to serve him, he is the one who adopted us orphans when we were in dire straits.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a third person mentioned in a discussion is present, the pronoun \japhug{ɯʑo}{he} is not the optimal way of referring to him/her, and a proximal demonstrative, in particular the reduplicated \japhug{the morpheme ___}{this}, is used instead. It can occur to present someone to someone else (\ref{ex:kWki.aslama}) (note that a similar usage exists in Western languages such as English in the same context) and even to talk about the actions of this person, as in (\ref{ex:kWki.kW.taBzu}) and (\ref{ex:kWki.nW.ftsWntCi}).

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When a third person mentioned in a discussion is present, the pronoun \japhug{ɯʑo}{he} is not the optimal way of referring to him/her, and a proximal demonstrative, in particular the reduplicated \japhug{kɯki}{this}, is used instead.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In addition to its function as a medial demonstrative (§\ref{sec:medial.dem.pro}), the demonstrative \forme{the morpheme ___} also occurs to express cataphoric reference. It occurs especially when the speaker hesitates and uses it as a filler, followed by a clause with the same verb (examples \ref{ex:nAki.YWNu} and \ref{ex:nAki.YAXtAr}) or just with the same auxiliary (\ref{ex:nAki.Nu.Ci}).

(continued by several paragraphs)'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is also used when the speaker alerts the addressee that a long description follows as in (\ref{ex:nAki.tustunW}), as in English `(he said) the following'. Given the fact the Japhug is strictly verb-final and has pre-verbal complements (§\ref{sec:basic.word.order}), this is a strategy employed to avoid relegating the main verb to the end of the description.
