The English translation of this sentence is:‘truly, I really jumped with energy’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the second set of examples in (\ref{Example_7.22}) and (\ref{Example_7.22}), the demonstratives are used adverbially to signal \isi{vividness}. In (\ref{Example_7.21}), \textitbf{ini} ‘\textsc{d.prox}’ modifies the \isi{verb} \textitbf{hidup} ‘live’, resulting in the emphatic reading \textitbf{hidup ini} ‘to be very much alive’. Along similar lines, in (\ref{Example_7.22}), \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘\textsc{d.dist}’ modifies the \isi{verb} \textitbf{lompat} ‘jump’, giving the emphatic reading \textitbf{lompat the morpheme ___} ‘really jumped’. Again, these examples illustrate the overlapping functions of the demonstratives: while indicating \isi{vividness}, they also have temporal uses. They signal temporal proximity indicating present tense in (\ref{Example_7.21}), and temporal distance indicating past tense in (\ref{Example_7.22}).

With this switch the speakers indicate that the location has become vivid to their minds and psychologically closer than \textitbf{sana} ‘\textsc{l.dist}’ would signal, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_7.59}) and (\ref{Example_7.60}).
