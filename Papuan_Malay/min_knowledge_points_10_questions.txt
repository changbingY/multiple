The English translation of this sentence is:‘I slept until the afternoon’

This does not, however, apply to the example in (\ref{Example_10.19}). When the \isi{prepositional phrase} is moved to the front it denotes the temporal starting rather than the temporal endpoint of \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleep’, as in (\ref{Example_10.20}). Hence, the meaning changes to ‘come afternoon’ (literally ‘reaches the afternoon’). One initial explanation for this change in meaning is that the utterance in (\ref{Example_10.20}) expresses a sequence of two events, namely the \textitbf{the morpheme ___} ‘reaching’ of the afternoon and subsequently the \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleeping’. In that case, \textitbf{the morpheme ___ sore} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘its gloss ___ afternoon’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘reached the afternoon’ or ‘come afternoon’. This explanation, however, requires further investigation.

Sentence (with missing item): sampe ___ saya tidor
Gloss (with missing item): reach ___ 1SG sleep
The English translation of this sentence is:‘come afternoon I slept’ (Lit. ‘reach the afternoon’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Typically, peripheral prepositional phrases can be moved to other positions within the clause with no change in meaning. This does not, however, apply to the example in (\ref{Example_10.19}). When the \isi{prepositional phrase} is moved to the front it denotes the temporal starting rather than the temporal endpoint of \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleep’, as in (\ref{Example_10.20}). Hence, the meaning changes to ‘come its gloss ___’ (literally ‘reaches the its gloss ___’). One initial explanation for this change in meaning is that the utterance in (\ref{Example_10.20}) expresses a sequence of two events, namely the \textitbf{sampe} ‘reaching’ of the its gloss ___ and subsequently the \textitbf{tidor} ‘sleeping’. In that case, \textitbf{sampe the morpheme ___} does not express the \isi{prepositional phrase} ‘until its gloss ___’ but the \isi{verbal clause} ‘reached the its gloss ___’ or ‘come its gloss ___’. This explanation, however, requires further investigation.
