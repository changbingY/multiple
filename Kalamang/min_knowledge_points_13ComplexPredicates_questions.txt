Multiple monoclausal Verb=i koyet constructions may be strung together in this way. There are no restrictions on the first verb in the predicate. Both verbs in the predicate share the same arguments. (\ref{exe:ewunat}) shows the construction with a transitive verb in a narrative about making a canoe from a tree trunk. (\ref{exe:yoriko}) is taken from the end of that narrative, and shows the construction on an intransitive verb.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: This is also the case for NPs carrying similative postposition\is{postposition!similative} =kap, like ododa `gado-gado' (a dish) in~(\ref{exe:ododang}). Most colour terms end in -gap or -kap and are probably derived from nouns marked with similative =kap (§\ref{sec:sim}), but are treated as monomorphemic. They can also be inflected with =i and become part of a complex predicate, like baranggap `yellow' in~(\ref{exe:gawi}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`O, they killed the older brother (by stabbing).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Complex action and result predicates express an action in the first verb and a result in the second verb.

The object of the first verb is the subject of the second, such that the verbs in the construction do not share any arguments. In~(\ref{exe:dakcamp}), it is unclear exactly whether campur `to mix' is the result obtained by chopping two ingredients and the same time, or whether this should be read as two sequential events.

The English translation of this sentence is:`The eagle wants to descend and grab him.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: With the meaning `its gloss ___' (discussed in detail in §\ref{sec:kin}), the morpheme ___ can be the first verb in a complex predicate, without any restriction on the semantics of the other verb. An example with bara `to descend' is given in~(\ref{exe:the morpheme ___bara}).\footnote{It is unclear whether the morpheme ___ `its gloss ___' can be used without volitional =kin (§\ref{sec:kin}). The corpus instances of the morpheme ___ followed by a verb that is not marked with =kin are ambiguous between the `its gloss ___' and the `say; think' reading.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`We don't [have to] remember to come and go anymore.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purposive motion serialisation can also be achieved with the directional verb ra `to move (along a path); to become' as V1. It is less generic than bo `to its gloss ___', described above, in that it specifies the path of motion in combination with the other verb. This is also evident from its use as the antonym of mia `to come' (as in~\ref{exe:the morpheme ___mina} above). In~(\ref{exe:mast}), the use of ra refers to the path from a floating fish cage to a boat. In~(\ref{exe:kulp}), the path from the speaker to the fire is indicated by ra. (\ref{exe:pasaromat}) is made with ra and the zero morpheme `give', to indicate the path between the giver and the recipient.

Sentence (with missing item): pi konenen=i koi ran ___
Gloss (with missing item): 1PL.EXCL remember=PLNK then go ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`We don't [have to] remember to come and go anymore.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Purposive motion serialisation can also be achieved with the directional verb ra `to move (along a path); to become' as V1. It is less generic than bo `to go', described above, in that it specifies the path of motion in combination with the other verb. This is also evident from its use as the antonym of mia `to come' (as in~\ref{exe:ranmina} above). In~(\ref{exe:mast}), the use of ra refers to the path from a floating fish cage to a boat. In~(\ref{exe:kulp}), the path from the speaker to the fire is indicated by ra. (\ref{exe:pasaromat}) is made with ra and the zero morpheme `give', to indicate the path between the giver and the recipient.
