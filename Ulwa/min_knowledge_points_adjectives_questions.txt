The English translation of this sentence is:`The big person hit the small dog.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When an \isi{adjective} is neither functioning as a substantive nor serving as a \isi{predicate complement}, it occurs within the limits of a \isi{noun phrase}. When inside an NP, adjectives occur after the noun (the \isi{head} of the NP) and before the \isi{subject marker}, \isi{object marker}, or any other \isi{determiner} that may be found in an NP. Such \isi{adnominal adjective}s never occur outside the NP (i.e., \isi{discontinuous}ly). Sentences \REF{ex:adj:1} through \REF{ex:adj:4} provide examples of adjectives (in \textbf{bold}) as they appear in NPs, illustrating their postnominal position, preceding \isi{determiner}s.
A: word: ambi	 gloss: big

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Adjectives may also function as substantives -- that is, they may have the same formal properties as prototypical nouns. In such cases, these adjectives have the same distribution as nouns. Thus, adjectives may serve as the \isi{head}s of NPs, which may themselves serve as subject \REF{ex:adj:8}, \isi{direct object} \REF{ex:adj:9}, or \isi{object of a postposition} \REF{ex:adj:10} within a clause.

The English translation of this sentence is:`That white person came.’\footnote{The form waembïl ankam ‘white person’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: One factor complicating the task of assigning words in Ulwa to the grammatical category of \isi{adjective} is the fact that adjectives in NPs sometimes precede their \isi{head noun}s (instead of following them). While some speakers consider this order to be ungrammatical (perhaps an influence from the \isi{word order} of \ili{Tok Pisin}; see \chapref{sec:15}), it nevertheless occurs in speech, thereby making it difficult to rely on the distributional criterion that adjectives follow nouns. This adjective-noun \isi{word order} is exemplified in sentences \REF{ex:adj:11}, \REF{ex:adj:12}, and \REF{ex:adj:13}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`They went around with their knowledge.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{morphosyntactic} similarity between nouns and adjectives also makes it difficult at times to assign certain words to one class or the other. For example, the word the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ can have either the more nominal meaning ‘its gloss ___, wisdom’ or the more adjectival meaning ‘its gloss ___able, knowing, wise’, and it is difficult to define one of these meanings as being the primary one. Whereas in \REF{ex:adj:14} this word carries a more noun-like meaning, in \REF{ex:adj:15} it functions more like a substantive \isi{adjective} (\sectref{sec:5.3}).

The English translation of this sentence is:`She knows you.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Complicating matters even further is the fact that kalam ‘knowledge, knowledgeable’ very often functions like a verb.
