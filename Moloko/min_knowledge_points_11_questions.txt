Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Although the presupposition-assertion construction is structurits gloss ___y a clause level phenomenon, it can function in information structuring at the proposition level both to mark a boundary in a discourse, to set topic, and in participant tracking\is{Cohesion!Participant tracking}. When a discourse conjunction or temporal adverb is marked as presupposed (\ref{ex:11:33}--\ref{ex:11:35}, see also \ref{ex:11:49} from \sectref{sec:11.5}), the clause as a whole marks a boundary in the discourse. Such a clause often indicates a time change or an episode boundary. Most of the episodes in the Disobedient Girl story (see \sectref{sec:1.5}) begin with a conjuction marked with na \REF{ex:11:34} or a na-marked temporal phrase (\ref{ex:11:33}, \ref{ex:11:35}). All na-marked elements are underlined in the examples.

The English translation of this sentence is:‘So, if the owner of the cows wasn’t there, [and] that the cows’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:11:53} the situation is more clear. We consider the two underlined the morpheme ___ markers to be the \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} DO pronomithe morpheme ___l since even though there are multiple the morpheme ___{}-marked elements in the clause, these underlined markers are neither at the end of the noun phrase (as they would be if they were the definite marker), nor are they immediately before the fithe morpheme ___l focussed element (as they would be if this was a presupposition-focus construction). The verb and noun phrases in question are each delimited by square brackets in the example. We found no uthe morpheme ___mbiguous instance of the presupposition marker the morpheme ___ breaking up a verb phrase except for the purpose of isolating the fithe morpheme ___l focussed element in a verb phrase (cf. integrity of the \VP, \sectref{sec:8.1}). Thus the first underlined the morpheme ___ is \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} \DO for the verb tozom ‘they eat.’ It is doubling the direct object noun phrase gəvax ‘field.'

Question 18:
You are a linguist specializing in Moloko. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ndɛ asa bahaj a ɬa na ndahaŋ aka baj ___ asa ɬa=ahaj na
Gloss (with missing item): so if chief GEN cow PSP 3S on NEG ___ if cow=Pl PSP
The English translation of this sentence is:‘So, if the owner of the cows wasn’t there, [and] that the cows’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:11:53} the situation is more clear. We consider the two underlined the morpheme ___ markers to be the \oldstylenums{3}\textsc{s} DO pronomithe morpheme ___l since even though there are multiple the morpheme ___{}-marked elements in the clause, these underlined markers are neither at the end of the noun phrase (as they would be if they were the definite marker), nor are they immediately before the fithe morpheme ___l focussed element (as they would be if this was a presupposition-focus construction). The verb and noun phrases in question are each delimited by square brackets in the example.
