Gloss (with missing item): 1PL.INCL now eye thus=COP-DEP way ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`We have now seen this kind of behavior.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some postpositions seem to function like verbs even without being followed by a \isi{locative verb} form. When such forms occur clause-finally and express the action or event of the \isi{predicate}, they may be considered to be verbs (albeit somewhat \isi{defective} ones). Indeed, they are likely verbs in origin, having begun a process of \isi{grammaticalization}, losing their \isi{verbal morphology} as they come to function more as postpositions. This seems to be the case with the \isi{suppletive} verb ala {\textasciitilde} andï(m/n) ‘see’, both \isi{stem}s of which are used as postpositions with the meaning ‘for’ or ‘from’. However, as \isi{separable verb}s (\sectref{sec:9.2.1}), these forms -- along with the \isi{nominal adjunct} lïmndï ‘eye’ -- convey the verbal meaning ‘see’, as in \REF{ex:otherwc:30}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Indeed, even when functioning as a verb, ala {\textasciitilde} andï(m/n) ‘see’ generally does not take any \isi{TAM} \isi{suffix}ation \REF{ex:otherwc:31}.

There is a tendency to place the \isi{temporal adverb} before \isi{postpositional phrase}s, as in \REF{ex:otherwc:42} and \REF{ex:otherwc:43}.

Gloss (with missing item): 1SG-POSS mother 3SG.SUBJ ___ house 3SG.OBJ=from down-go.PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`My mother went down around the house first.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Whereas ta ‘already’ is clearly monomorphemic, the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ and anganika ‘after’ are each apparently derived from multiple morphemes: the former consisting of the noun ip ‘nose’ and the \isi{postposition} ka ‘at, in, on’, the latter consisting of the noun angani ‘rear’ and the \isi{postposition} ka ‘at, in, on’. While the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is derived from a crosslinguistically common body-part \isi{metaphor}, \mbox{anganika} ‘after’ (often shortened to [naka]) is not necessarily so, since angani ‘rear’ is not typically used to refer to any part of the human body (cf. mutam ‘back’ and unmbï ‘buttocks’). Sentences \REF{ex:otherwc:61} through \REF{ex:otherwc:64} illustrate the adverbial use of the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ and anganika ‘after’.

The English translation of this sentence is:`Tell them later!’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Whereas ta ‘already’ is clearly monomorphemic, ipka ‘before’ and the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ are each apparently derived from multiple morphemes: the former consisting of the noun ip ‘nose’ and the \isi{postposition} ka ‘at, in, on’, the latter consisting of the noun angani ‘rear’ and the \isi{postposition} ka ‘at, in, on’. While ipka ‘before’ is derived from a crosslinguistically common body-part \isi{metaphor}, \mbox{the morpheme ___} ‘its gloss ___’ (often shortened to [naka]) is not necessarily so, since angani ‘rear’ is not typically used to refer to any part of the human body (cf. mutam ‘back’ and unmbï ‘buttocks’).

The English translation of this sentence is:`As for us, we came after [our] fathers.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Whereas anganika ‘after’ is viewed here as a single \isi{adverb} (that is, not composed of [angani] and [ka], at least not synchronically) and thus should not accept any \isi{morphological} \isi{inflection}, the \isi{postposition} angani ‘behind’ (as a \isi{postposition}) can indeed have an \isi{object-marker} \isi{clitic}, as in \REF{ex:otherwc:65} and \REF{ex:otherwc:66}.

An additional complication is the clear relationship between the adverbs ipka ‘before’ and anganika ‘after’ and the verbs ip ka- ‘precede’ and angani ka- ‘follow’, respectively (\sectref{sec:9.2.3}).

You are a linguist specializing in Ulwa. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): ay nï ___ apa mbï-p-e ma-n-e
Gloss (with missing item): ay 1SG ___ house here-be-DEP go-IPFV-DEP
The English translation of this sentence is:`Ay, am I just going to stay here?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Three forms that are frequently used in discourse are the morpheme ___ {\textasciitilde} ko {\textasciitilde} wa ‘its gloss ___’, the first of which is identical to the \isi{numeral} the morpheme ___ ‘one’, and the second of which is clearly derived from the first.\footnote{The form wa ‘its gloss ___’ may also be related to the morpheme ___ ‘one’, although its derivation is less clear.} All three forms share essentially the same set of functions. Often translated as ‘its gloss ___’, they add a degree of casualness to a statement. Sometimes they convey a sense of ‘simply’, other times a mildly \isi{negative} sense of ‘without care’ or ‘without reason’. Very often, however, it is hard for me to ascribe any clear meaning to them (at least in the \ili{English} translation). These three forms -- the morpheme ___ {\textasciitilde} ko {\textasciitilde} wa ‘its gloss ___’ -- are illustrated by examples \REF{ex:otherwc:131}, \REF{ex:otherwc:132}, and \REF{ex:otherwc:133}, respectively.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Similar in function to kwa {\textasciitilde} ko {\textasciitilde} wa ‘just’ and lolop ‘just’ is the word the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___, fruitlessly’, which has a much more \isi{negative} connotation. This word looks very much like it has derived from other words, in part because of the unusual \isi{diphthong} [oy] (\sectref{sec:2.1.7}). It may derive from /wa-i-ambï=n/ ‘just-go.\textsc{pfv-sg.refl=obl’} -- that is, a \isi{phrase} having meant something like ‘just went with himself/herself/itself’. This is only speculative.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] went following the Biwat river, went up. Having gone up, [they] came this way. And then from here, [they] came and built our jungle [area].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some of the adverbs described in \sectref{sec:8.2.3} also seem to behave at times much like \isi{modal} or discourse adverbs, carrying subtle connotations or serving various discourse functions. The \isi{adverb} the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___, in turn’ may be used in narratives to tie together events in series, especially when they are somewhat repetitive. It may thus often be translated with the \ili{English} expression ‘and then …’.

Its usage here seems parallel to \isi{modal} uses of \ili{Tok Pisin} tu ‘its gloss ___, too’, and it is possibly a \isi{calque} of that word (cf. similar phenomena in \chapref{sec:15}). It can be used to add a degree of incredulity, to strengthen a \isi{request} for confirmation in a \isi{question}, or to add a sense of wonder to a statement.

Sentence (with missing item): maka=p-e i ___
Gloss (with missing item): thus=COP-DEP way ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Behavior like that -- that’s it.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The \isi{interjection} the morpheme ___ ‘that’s it’ is used to signal the \isi{emphatic} identification of a referent or to show approval of a thought or action.\footnote{Cf. \ili{Tok Pisin} em nau ‘it now’, used as an \isi{interjection} to mean ‘that’s it’.} The word may contain the word maw ‘correct’, although I consider it also possible that this shorter word is itself a \isi{backformation} from the morpheme ___ ‘that’s it’. The [-nam] ending suggests a pronominal origin of this word (cf. the \isi{emphatic} \isi{suffix} -nam ‘\textsc{emph}’, \sectref{sec:6.7}). Perhaps it is an elaboration of the form mï-nam ‘3\textsc{sg.subj}-\textsc{emph}’. The form the morpheme ___ ‘that’s it’ may take the ending [-e]. It is unclear whether this is the \isi{dependent marker} -e ‘\textsc{dep}’ (\sectref{sec:12.2.1}) or simply a further \isi{emphatic} \isi{syllable}. Sentences \REF{ex:otherwc:155} through \REF{ex:otherwc:158} exemplify the use of the morpheme ___ ‘that’s it’.
