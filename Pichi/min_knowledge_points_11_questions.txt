Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: SVCs involving ték are less frequent than equivalent combinations of verbs and prepositions. A PP involving the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ is more commonly employed to express the semantic role of instrument\index{} \REF{ex:key:1570}. Comitative ték{}-serialisations are even less common. Speakers usually resort to a PP introduced by the preposition the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___’ as in \REF{ex:key:1575} further below:

B: word: wet=an	 gloss: with=3SG.OBJ

This structure is now in fact identical to some of the depictive secondary predications covered in section \sectref{sec:11.3}, e.g. \REF{ex:key:1601}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Animacy provides additional cues to the meaning of constructions involving secondary predication. When the object of a transitive verb has an animate object as in \REF{ex:key:1601} (i.e. mí ‘\textsc{1sg.indp’),} the secondary predicate may be interpreted as either subject- or object-oriented. In such cases, the secondary predicate requires a subject pronoun in order to establish reference with either of the two participants:\is{adjuncts}

The secondary predicated is an object-oriented resultative adjunct that denotes the resultant state of the event denoted by the primary predicate:

The English translation of this sentence is:‘They prepared the coffee (it’s) too sweet.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Sentence \REF{ex:key:1603} features the effected-object verb\is{} the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___, prepare’ as a primary predicate. Note that the secondary predicate takes the subject\is{subjects} pronoun e ‘\textsc{3sg.sbj}’, which is co-referential with the primary predicate object café ‘coffee’. The overt subject pronoun is not necessary here because the resultative predicate is clearly object-oriented (unlike the primary predicate presented in \ref{ex:key:1588} above). I assume that an explicit subject pronoun is nevertheless employed because of the presence of the preverbal degree adverb tú ‘too (much)’. This its gloss ___s the secondary predicate more complex and motivates the use of a finite resultative clause featuring an overt subject:
A: word: mék	 gloss: make

Question 156:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Dɛn bíl=an ___ stáyl.
Gloss (with missing item): 3PL build=3SG.OBJ ___ style
The English translation of this sentence is:‘They built it (and it’s) shoddy.’ or ‘They built it shoddily.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Resultatives may be paraphrased by employing a nominal strategy. The resultative secondary predicate in \REF{ex:key:1604}, i.e. the property item the morpheme ___ ‘be its gloss ___, messed up’ may be vaguely paraphrased via an NP in which it appears as a prenominal modifier to the generic noun stáyl ‘manner’ \REF{ex:key:1605}. The generic noun stáyl ‘manner’ is also used in modifications of manner (cf. e.g. \ref{ex:key:880} in \sectref{sec:7.7.2}) and in manner question words (cf. e.g. \ref{ex:key:629} in \sectref{sec:7.3.2}), hence in \REF{ex:key:1605}, it is ambiguous between a participant-oriented resultative reading and an event-oriented manner reading:
A: word: wɔwɔ́	 gloss: ugly
B: word: wɔ-wɔwɔ́	 gloss: ?RED.CPD-ugly
C: word: níd=an	 gloss: need=3SG.OBJ
D: word: kɛ́r=an	 gloss: carry=3SG.OBJ
