The English translation of this sentence is:`We will listen to the talk of the middle-aged (men).'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The less prototypical status of human nouns also shows in words like \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{apura} `widow' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{oosa} `widower' which may occur by themselves as heads of a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}, but which are most typically used as post-modifiers of \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{emeria} `woman' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{mua} `man', respectively.\footnote{Other words in this group are \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{muupera}\textbf{ }`visitor, guest' and especially \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{weria}, which as a human noun only occurs in the combination \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{mua weria}, `uncle/ male cross cousin/ nephew'. The \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{mua weria'}s are responsible for burying a dead person and dispensing of his/her belongings (\sectref{sec:1.3.6}).} As age in human beings tends to be treated as a crucial determinant of \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{kind}}, even languages with large adjective classes often have special nouns for referring to old persons \citep[368]{Wierzbicka1986}. In Mauwake, adjectives that indicate age in humans are non-prototypical, more noun-like than most adjectives: both \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{the morpheme ___} `its gloss ___' \REF{ex:3:x25} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{panewowa} `old' are used as the head of a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} besides the typical adjectival use.

The claim is based on the fact that the noun category is the more basic and universally recognized, whereas the existence of the adjective category is disputed in some languages; in Mauwake the noun class is clearly established, large, and more easily definable. Also, there are at least two nouns in Mauwake that currently seem to be in the process of becoming regular adjectives: the meaning of the phrase stays the same with the pre-modifying noun and the post-modifying adjective \REF{ex:3:x107}--\REF{ex:3:x1823}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is a fairly common feature in languages that pronouns can either modify a noun in a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} or replace a full \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}, but cannot be the head of a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} taking modifiers \citep[e.g.][]{ HakulinenEtAl1979,Saari1985,Roberts1987}. In Mauwake the personal pronouns usually occur without modifiers, but they \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{can}} be modified by a demonstrative, provided there is no collocational clash between the demonstrative and the personal pronoun \REF{ex:3:x530}, \REF{ex:3:x531}.

Gloss (with missing item): big this uncle ___ well 3.DAT grab-NpFU.3p
The English translation of this sentence is:`These big ones the uncles may take from her.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A pronoun copy after a full \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} is hardly ever used in Mauwake for the subject. The rare example \REF{ex:3:x683} is from a hortatory text and may show rhetoric style:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The main use of the unmarked pronouns is as subjects. In narratives, only the person marking on the verb, rather than a pronoun, is used for an established, continuing subject/topic (\sectref{sec:9.2.2}). Especially third person unmarked pronouns marking the subject are quite rare in narrative texts \REF{ex:3:x533}, \REF{ex:3:x534}; first person pronouns are relatively much more common \REF{ex:3:x1803} \citep[79--80]{Jarvinen1991}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Cross-linguistically a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{possessive predicate}} construction, a `have' construction, has often been derived from a locative or a goal/dative construction, plus a verb of existence \citep[50--61]{Heine1997}. In the possessive predicates in Mauwake the dative pronoun precedes the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{-} `be' \REF{ex:3:x1788} The possessive predicate construction is discussed in more detail in \sectref{sec:5.5.2}. .

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same dative pronoun has also grammaticalized as a possessive attribute in a noun phrase , but here it is the semantic function of [+\textstyleEmphasizedWords{{human}}] \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{source}} that is behind the development. Conceptually the structures `\textstyleAcronymallcaps{X} took \textstyleAcronymallcaps{Y} from me' and `\textstyleAcronymallcaps{X} took my \textstyleAcronymallcaps{Y}' are very close.

[1s.\textsc{unm} not 1s.\textsc{dat} come-\textsc{imp}.2s] `Don't come to me!' } \citet[133]{Heine1997} mentions that early in the grammaticalization process ``these expressions can simultaneously be interpreted with reference to either their non-posses\-sive source or to possession.'' In \REF{ex:3:x1861} and \REF{ex:3:x1862} the source interpretation is not possible.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the Mauwake lexicon the verbs are divided into classes 1 and 2 depending on whether they have \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{a} or \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{E} as the past tense suffix. There are morphophonological rules for deriving the past tense marking for most verbs (\sectref{sec:2.3.3.3}), but since some of the rules are rather complicated, and because they do not cover a number of cases like \REF{ex:3:x253} and \REF{ex:3:x254} below, the division into two separate classes is maintained.
A: word: miim-o-k	 gloss: precede-PA-3s

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The directional verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.4.4.5}) could be treated as weakly transitive, in which case the goal \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}, which is never marked with the locative clitic -pa, could be a locative object. There are two main reasons against this analysis. When the goal of a directional verb is a personal pronoun, the dative case is used rather than the accusative \REF{ex:3:x1870}.

Gloss (with missing item): bow=COM ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Did they shoot you with a gun?'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: I call these verbs object cross-referencing because, besides marking the subject with a suffix like all other verbs do, they also \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{obligatorily}} mark the object in the verb root. What has clearly been a prefix\footnote{Phonetically this prefix is closer to the unmarked pronouns than the accusative pronouns.} earlier has been grammaticalized as part of the verb itself: there is no neutral root that would not be linked to any particular person \REF{ex:3:x334}--\REF{ex:3:x336}.\footnote{When a ``neutral'' form is required, the third person singular is used.} In this respect these verbs differ from all the other verbs in Mauwake. In the case of `give' the verb root \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{i}- has assimilated into the prefix, so currently the person marking of the recipient object is the only root that there is. Four of the object cross-referencing verbs are listed in \tabref{tab:3:crossreferencingverbs}.

Sentence (with missing item): Wi ___ pok-ap ik-ua.
Gloss (with missing item): 3p.UNM ___ sit.down-SS.SEQ be-PA.3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`He sat hiding among them.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The cross-referenced objects are semantically quite different. In the verbs \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw}- `give (him)' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{onak}- `feed (him)' it is the recipient,\footnote{\textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{onak-} `feed (him)' requires a food term as the undergoer object, so a better translation, but longer, would be `give him (something) to eat'.} in \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{war}- `shoot (him)' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ook}- `follow (him)' the undergoer. The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{wionar}-\footnote{A possible origin for this is \textit{\textsc{pron}+onaiya+ar}- `become together-with \textsc{pron}' (Kwan, p.c.)} `hide among (them)' is a special case in two ways: the cross-referenced argument `among a group' is quite untypical as a verbal argument; and only plural forms of this verb can be used because of semantic restrictions: \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{yionar-} `hide among us', \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nionar-} `hide among you (pl)', \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{wionar-} `hide among them' \REF{ex:3:x337}.

The causative suffix -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ow} was described above in \sectref{sec:3.8.2.3.1}. In most cases the meaning of a causative is `to cause someone or something to do something'. The caused `doing' is usually \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{not} }agentive \REF{ex:3:x992}.

But it is like other intransitive verbs in that it can take an causative suffix \REF{ex:3:x261}.\footnote{\citet[142]{Reesink1987} notes that in Usan the corresponding verb \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{igo} `be' cannot occur with the causative suffix. In Mauwake there is no similar restriction.}

The continuous aspect form in Mauwake can have either progressive \REF{ex:3:x349}, \REF{ex:3:x1044} or habitual \REF{ex:3:x350}, \REF{ex:3:x1045} interpretation. The main verb is in the same-subject simultaneous medial form, but with the final /i/ deleted, and the auxiliary \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be' is inflected for tense and person/number \REF{ex:3:x350}.
A: word: aw-em-ik-eya	 gloss: burn-SS.SIM-be-2/3s.DS
B: word: ikiw-em-ik-eya	 gloss: go-SS.SIM-be-2/3s.DS

Question 500:
You are a linguist specializing in Mauwake. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. However, a word and its gloss are missing and represented by an underscore. Based on your understanding, please choose the most appropriate option. 
Sentence (with missing item): Waaya ___ mik-a-m.
Gloss (with missing item): pig ___ spear-PA-1s
The English translation of this sentence is:`As the pig was going/coming up I speared it.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: When the verbal group is in the medial form, the progressive interpretation \REF{ex:3:x353} is the more common:
A: word: urup-em-ik-eya	 gloss: ascend-SS.SIM-be-2/3s.DS
B: word: urup-em-ika-iwkin	 gloss: ascend-SS.SIM-be-2/3p.DS

Sentence (with missing item): Kawus ___ kuuf-a-k.
Gloss (with missing item): smoke ___ see-PA-3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`The smoke was rising and she saw it.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Often the context provides the only clue as to whether the continuous aspect form should be interpreted as progressive or habitual. The example \REF{ex:3:x354} describes a situation where the villagers kept feeding the Japanese soldiers who asked them for food; the sentence \REF{ex:3:x355} is from a text describing a coconut plantation fire and its consequences.
A: word: ir-am-ik-eya	 gloss: rise-SS.SIM-be-2/3s.DS

Gloss (with missing item): taro roast-NMZ eat-Np-PR.1/3p water not ___ coconut water not eat-Np-PR.1/3p sugarcane only eat-SS.SIM-be-Np-PR.1/3p
The English translation of this sentence is:`We do not eat roasted taro. We do not drink water or coconut water. We only eat / keep eating sugarcane.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: For a clause to have habitual interpretation it is not obligatory to use the continuous aspect form in the verb. For instance in process descriptions, which tell how something is habitually done, the unmarked, aspectually neutral present tense form is more common than the continuous aspect. Three of the four verbs in \REF{ex:3:x1049} are aspectually unmarked, although all the clauses have habitual interpretation, describing seclusion customs.
A: word: enim-i-mik	 gloss: eat-Np-PR.1/3p
B: word: miim-i-mik	 gloss: precede-NP-PR.1/3p
C: word: enim-i-yem	 gloss: eat-Np-PR.1s

Sentence (with missing item): ___ epa wiim-o-k.
Gloss (with missing item): ___ place dawn-PA-3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`As we were sitting it dawned.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The same semantic component of continuity is also shared by the other aspect using the auxiliary ik- `be': this time it is a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{state}} rather than activity that continues the same over time. In the stative aspect, the auxiliary is combined with a main verb that is in the same-subject sequential form. This usage is most common with the position-taking verbs like \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pok}- `sit down' \REF{ex:3:x356}, \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iimar}- `stand up' \REF{ex:3:x1046} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{in}- `lie down/ fall asleep'.

The English translation of this sentence is:`As we were waiting the car arrived at five.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In \REF{ex:3:x359} the continuous form indicates more active waiting process than is the case in \REF{ex:3:x360} with the stative aspect. In \REF{ex:3:x359} the people were getting impatient with the vehicle that should already have come to get them. The example \REF{ex:3:x360} is from a description of garden work, and part of the work process is the state of patiently waiting for the felled trees and undergrowth to dry.

Gloss (with missing item): 3p.ACC ___ 3p.ACC stare-descend-PA-3s
The English translation of this sentence is:`He stared them up and down.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Semantically the verb combinations are of two types. In the more common one a directional or another motion verb follows another verb stem, giving the meaning of \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{movement}} to the whole \REF{ex:3:x378}-\REF{ex:3:x438}, and often the meaning of \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{directionality}} as well \REF{ex:3:x379}-\REF{ex:3:x381}.\footnote{Cross-linguistically motion and location verbs are very common in serial verbs \citep[9]{Lord1993}.} This is a productive process, as long as the verbs are semantically compatible.

The English translation of this sentence is:`You kept rubbing it (over the years) and now you have grown up.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: A motion verb in a serial construction can also indicate \textstyleEmphasizedWords{{temporal continuity}} over a long period of time. In \REF{ex:3:x439} the length of time is emphasized even more by the repetition of the motion verb.
A: word: ife-iki(w-e)p	 gloss: rub-go-SS.SEQ

The English translation of this sentence is:`He bit off half of the sago cake and fed it to the dog.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In the second type, any two verbs can, in principle, combine into a serial verb. But this process is less productive, and both the type and token frequency of this type is low when compared with the frequency of the first type. Usually, like in \REF{ex:3:x382} the meaning of the whole is transparent and can be inferred from the meanings of the component roots, but sometimes the semantics are more opaque \REF{ex:3:x383}.

Sentence (with missing item): Fura ___ puuk-a-m.
Gloss (with missing item): knife ___ cut-PA-1s
The English translation of this sentence is:`I took a knife and cut it.' Or: `I cut it with a knife.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: In Mauwake the clause chaining is structurally midway between serialization and main clause coordination, and may consequently be used instead of either in some cases. The instrumental may in Mauwake be expressed by a `take-instrument-do' structure \REF{ex:3:x387} which in many serializing languages is a serial verb construction \citep[162--74]{Sebba1987}; but in Mauwake there is no good reason to call the structure anything other than a combination of a medial and final clause. This shows more clearly in example \REF{ex:3:x388}, which does not pass the rule for verbal groups: ``no non-verbal elements between the parts''.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The borderline between serial verbs and medial verbs on the one hand, and between verb + \textstyleAcronymallcaps{aux} groups and medial verbs on the other is not absolutely clear-cut. In \REF{ex:3:x389} the medial verb structure is used instead of a serial verb, even though the two actions are simultaneous, not sequential as indicated by the form of the medial verb.\footnote{Mauwake does not allow same subject simultaneous forms following each other except in a strictly coordinate structure where the verbs do not so much indicate simultaneity with each other as with the final verb.}

The English translation of this sentence is:`They heard about us and came to greet us.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: The nominal adjuncts look like object \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}s, and the origin of at least some of them probably is in object \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np}s, but currently there are syntactic and semantic differences between the two. An object \textstyleAcronymallcaps{np} may be separated from the verb by the negator adverb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{me} or by an accusative or a dative pronoun, but a nominal adjunct must immediately precede the verb \REF{ex:3:x450}. The meaning of the nominal adjunct plus verb construction often cannot be derived from the meanings of its constituent parts.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It is possible to have two or more clitics attached to the same word; only the topic marker does not allow other clitics with it. A case marking clitic, forming a constituent with the preceding noun phrase, is placed first. Next comes the focus clitic \REF{ex:3:x792}, with the scope over a phrase but not forming a constituent. The limiter \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw} may have a phrase with the focus marking in its scope, so it follows the focus marker. When the limiter follows another clitic, there is a transition consonant <r>between the clitics \REF{ex:3:x795}, \REF{ex:3:x796}. The modal clitic \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{yon} `perhaps' (\sectref{sec:3.9.3}) may have a scope over a whole predication, so its position is after the limiter \REF{ex:3:x793}. The sentential clitic, with a scope over the whole sentence, comes last. When the contrastive focus marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ke} and the question marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{i} are adjacent, they become a portmanteau clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ki} \REF{ex:3:x794}.

When the limiter follows another clitic, there is a transition consonant <r>between the clitics \REF{ex:3:x795}, \REF{ex:3:x796}. The modal clitic \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{yon} `perhaps' (\sectref{sec:3.9.3}) may have a scope over a whole predication, so its position is after the limiter \REF{ex:3:x793}. The sentential clitic, with a scope over the whole sentence, comes last. When the contrastive focus marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ke} and the question marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{i} are adjacent, they become a portmanteau clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ki} \REF{ex:3:x794}.
