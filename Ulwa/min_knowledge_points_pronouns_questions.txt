Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Some speakers have reported an alternative 3\textsc{du} pronominal form /the morpheme ___/. However, it is not well attested in my corpus. The only examples of it seem to reflect an adnominal \isi{demonstrative} rather than a \isi{personal pronoun}. I suspect that it is an abridged form of the \isi{dual} \isi{distal} \isi{demonstrative} athe morpheme ___ (cf. the form [nda] for the \isi{singular} \isi{distal} \isi{demonstrative} anda, \sectref{sec:7.3}). The form [the morpheme ___], for example, occurs at the end of an NP in \REF{ex:pron:1}.

The English translation of this sentence is:`His good ones [= daughters] are in the house.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: It may here be noted that possessive forms need not necessarily precede nouns. Although they cannot precede verbs (without the verbs having been \isi{nominalize}d), they can precede \isi{adjective}s. This happens, however, only when the \isi{adjective} is functioning substantively (i.e., nominally) (\sectref{sec:5.3}), as in \REF{ex:pron:12} and \REF{ex:pron:13}. This further suggests that there is little if any \isi{morphosyntactic} distinction between property words (i.e., “\isi{adjective}s”) and \isi{semantic}ally more prototypical nouns.
A: word: ma-nji	 gloss: 3SG.OBJ-POSS

Gloss (with missing item): [name] 3SG.SUBJ ___
The English translation of this sentence is:`Tambana will hit herself.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Thus, these pronouns are similar to their \ili{English} translations ending in ‘-self’ or ‘-selves’, in that there is no distinction made among them for \isi{person} -- whether first, second, or third -- but they are distinguished for \isi{number}. These three forms are based on the same root, /amb(ï)-/. The use of \isi{reflexive} pronouns is illustrated by examples \REF{ex:pron:16} through \REF{ex:pron:22}.
A: word: ambï=wali-nda	 gloss: SG.REFL=hit-IRR

Sentence (with missing item): ___ ambï=ul unda-t-e na-kï-p
Gloss (with missing item): ___ SG.REFL=with go{-spec-dep} DETR-say-PFV
The English translation of this sentence is:`[He] thought that [the crocodile] might go around with him to kill him.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: There are indications that the \is{binding} \isi{binding domain} for \isi{anaphor}s (i.e., \isi{reflexive} pronouns) in Ulwa may be something greater than the clause -- that is, unlike in \ili{English}, it is possible for the \isi{antecedent} of a \isi{reflexive} \isi{pronoun} in Ulwa to be located in a so-called higher clause. All known examples of this occur when the \isi{matrix clause} (containing the \isi{antecedent}) introduces the \isi{embedded clause} (containing the \isi{reflexive} \isi{pronoun}) by means of a verb of speaking (or thinking).\footnote{Thus, Ulwa may be said to exhibit a sort \isi{logophoricity}, since these \isi{reflexive}s must be bound by an \isi{antecedent} whose \isi{speech} (or thought) is being reported. It should be noted, however, that there is no special \isi{logophoric pronoun} in Ulwa.} Examples \REF{ex:pron:23} and \REF{ex:pron:24} illustrate the use of \isi{reflexive} pronouns with \isi{antecedent}s in a “higher” clause.

The English translation of this sentence is:`[They] went to them, went to them in the village, and fought with them [as enemies].’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example, with the related morphemes and glosses masked: Also to be mentioned here is an interesting \isi{idiom}atic use of the \isi{reflexive} pronominal \isi{object marker} ambla= ‘\textsc{pl.refl}’. When used with the verb asa- {\textasciitilde} wali- ‘hit, kill’, this marker does not necessarily have a \isi{reflexive} (or reciprocal) sense, but rather gives the entire verb the \isi{intransitive} meaning ‘fight’ (as in battle). The object of fighting (the enemy) can be marked in a \isi{postpositional phrase} with the \isi{postposition} ul ‘with’. This can cause ambiguity not unlike what often occurs in \ili{English}, since this same \isi{postpositional phrase} can mark either enemies or allies.\footnote{Cf. \ili{English} sentences such as The English fought with the French.} Sentences \REF{ex:pron:26}, \REF{ex:pron:27}, and \REF{ex:pron:28} exemplify this use of the verb asa- {\textasciitilde} wali- ‘hit, kill’ with the \isi{reflexive} pronominal \isi{object marker} ambla= ‘\textsc{pl.refl}’.

Accordingly, when the ‘who’ or ‘what’ being asked about is not the grammatical subject, but rather the object of a verb, then the \isi{interrogative} \isi{pronoun} occurs in the typical object position (i.e., immediately before the verb), as in examples \REF{ex:pron:57} through \REF{ex:pron:60}.
A: word: kwa	 gloss: one

Significantly, whereas modifiers of NPs such as \isi{adjective}s or \isi{determiner}s follow their associated NPs (\sectref{sec:9.1}), the modifying element the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___?’ precedes its NP. This could serve the functional means of differentiating between ‘its gloss ___ [NP]?’ and ‘[NP] \textsc{neg}’.\footnote{Cf. \textbf{the morpheme ___ tïn} mamap ‘its gloss ___ dog ate it?’ vs. \textbf{tïn the morpheme ___} mamap ‘the dog did not eat it’.} Sentences \REF{ex:pron:61} through \REF{ex:pron:64} illustrate the use of the morpheme ___ ‘its gloss ___?’.
