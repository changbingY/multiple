Furthermore, the distinction between subject and non-subject forms, generally only observable in \textsc{3sg} forms, is mostly eroded in Yaul, since the subject form /mï/ is frequently pronounced [ma] (< /mï-a/), thereby becoming \isi{homophonous} with the non-subject form /ma/. However, the distinction seems to be partially maintained in the \textsc{3du}, where the non-subject form has the \isi{allomorph} [mini=] when immediately preceding /n-/. In fact, in Yaul, as opposed to in Manu, /l-/ conditions this \isi{allomorphy} as well as /n-/, as illustrated by \REF{ex:mdy:10}.
